I am so sick of being aliveIts been 10 years now that my depression has been making me suicidal to the point where I am so obsessed with death and fantasising about me dying I have had therapy when I was younger but was discharged at 17 because I was too old and left still in the same state I was in when I first got help My first suicide attempt was at 9 years old That was 10 years ago and I am still the same I truthfully believe nothing will get better so I have gave up I do not WANT to try anymore I do not WANT to live a life where I am crippled with severe body dysmorphia and other problems I am too afraid to leave the house I cover my face in public in fear Ill scare people I hate myself Death is the only way to free myself from all the problems in my life I do not want to breathe anymore I do not want to be on this earth I have tried for years to get better and I have not gotten anywhere I have my first therapy appointment in august I am not sure if I am going to go I do not see the point tbh I do not want help,Suicidal

Creating unneeded stress to myself Heres a stupid reason for ya Just earlier today I updated the YouTube app on one of my older iPads for the purpose of trying to screenshot some sort of tutorial for one of the newer features suddenly popping up when I thought it was it on just one of my devices Now because of that action Im stressing myself out for no reason because I didnt take the time to screenshot how the app looked beforehand so I could examine whatever differences there were before and after the update I dont have any more devices to try again so Im just SOL now,Anxiety/Stress

Im having palpitations right now Before anyone reads Im in the middle of an anxiety attack so everything in this post is everywhere and some words may be misspelled I think I know why too because the last time it happened I ate food that caused me to have a previous anxiety attack After I finish this Im going to get some sleep so I will read any comments and make the necessary corrections to this post in the morning So anyway I went across the street from work today to get some food from this chicken spot called Kennedy Chicken I live in NYC theyre on every corner ALL of their food is super duper unhealthy Its all deep fried foods Chicken and mozzarella sticks is what I ate They even gave me spoiled marinara sauce which I didnt eat because I noticed as soon as I opened the sauce container the air pressure made the sauce fly everywhere on my hands and there were bubbles in it I smelled it and it had an obvious spoiled smell to it like fermented tomatoes Im never eating from there again EVER And honestly I dont know how theyre even still open It has been a while since I ate their food until today Ive been trying to eat healthier foods Even if I have to order out on days I dont pack my lunch at home I choose a healthier option OR or It could be that I havent been getting enough sleep since Monday And everytime I feel the palpitations coming on I always go to sleep and the next morning I feel better Ive been to the ER multiple times for palpitations and they tell me its due to stress and not enough sleep I work a full time job and I used up all my pto so its difficult for me to take a day or two off for myself figuratively rips hair out I hate working full time and I think Im about to make a big sacrifice and go part time Or maybe I just need to ride it out I have so many financial issues right now that I cant do this anymore I want to move back home with my family but I dont have a car I dont have money I need to buy at least a months worth of food for 1 person me so I dont have to order out I dont have any idea how Ive come this far and havent ended up homeless At this point Im rambling and I need a hug but these are things Im dealing with at the moment That food honestly tasted horrible though Im betting on my palpitations being caused by both lack of sleep and the fast food though I wish there was a way to get my rent lowered so that I can afford to pay all my bills properly I might talk to my roommate about it and see what she says Okay if I have anything else left to talk about Ill make another post Thank you to anyone who decides to read this craziness,Anxiety/Stress

Some context I manage a person who is young late twenties but when angry acts like a toddler throwing a tantrum who is a gaslighting bully Shes wellconnected at my workplace so gets lots of support from her friends who she talks to and presents this alternative reality to them about her version of situations This is problematic because she also needs disciplinary action because of bullying behavior toward other staff customers and myself but any movement toward that leads to a tantrum She presents herself as friendly and sympathetic often the victim of the situation so people believe her I suffer from anxiety low selfesteem and depression so this is a nightmare for me,Anxiety/Stress

Our society is run by insane people for insane objectives A large part of my s is internal I wanted to have a good life so I went with what I thought was the most responsible thing to do Invest my money 4 years later holding the same companies I have lost most of it Then Robinhood entered the picture and took me on a ride of misery and loss I did not think possible The deeper hole I got into the more addicted I became the more loss I incurred and yes I know my equities will rebound only after I am gone as is intended in the fabric of what the market is but even so I cannot get the many years wasted back and I will not sell them to my death When they rebound and please wait until they do get an advisor to analyze the best time to sell for each equity and split the money evenly between Matthew and Chloe Please do not make the stock market a part of your life For most people it will only bring pain and enrich companies who have no intent on returning your investment Society and technology have made it implausible that I can live a decent life After working for years no girlfriend my money eaten up by inflation and losing value in markets Owning a home is an impossibility My salary barely keeps me afloat and I am a slave to an endless grind leading nowhere Losing yourself in your passion is the only respite to the pain do not believe anything the media tells you People do not want to hate each other I pray this late stage capitalism post pandemic were in does not take anymore lives than it must Greed is the root of all evil Technology is the leaf that allows it to grow New York has become inhospitable and the writing is on the wall After everything I am too tired now to reroute and try again Music is healing Laughter is healing Love is healing I love you Love,Depression
I lost my dog two months ago I let him out to run for a bit at night and never saw him again He was a lively dog and in my place it is normal to let your dogs out and run around the neighborhood I always thought he would come back I thought maybe he just found a female dog and do dog stuff but days turned to weeks and weeks turned to monthsNow I am lying awake in my bed crying my eyes out at the painful realization he is gone And I ask myself why Why did I let him out that night Why could not I just waited for him to come back instead of sleeping and expecting he will be back in the morning Why did not I give him more love and care Why did I complain about cleaning his pee and shit Why did not I hold him more Why did not I hug him more when it was clear he loved being petted by me Why did not I treat him better Why did not I make his short life better I do not even have proper pictures of himI have so many regrets and the heavy pain I have in my heart is pulling me down I have taken my meds but them seem useless at this momentI can only pray and hope that if he is gone he would be in a happier place with all the other dogs I have lostit is easier to accept death when I saw it with my own eyes It was easier for me to accept my other dogs deaths when I managed to properly say goodbye and bury themBut this heavy feeling of not knowing where my dog is if he is alive or not if he is okay if he is trying to come back home and in the worst case scenario if he suffered before passing away It hurts not knowing what happened and probably never getting answersWherever you are I hope you are at peace I love you I lost my dog and I feel like a useless human being,Depression

Realization after a tarot reading First of all I dont 100 believe in tarot reading It usually just reads current energy but future reading is usually just for guidance and would change afterall our future ultimately depends on us and our actions I am not clinically diagnosed as having depression because of lack of funds but I had a test last year from our office and I scored a level 4 in terms of depression I guess thats the most one can get I think I got that score because because I scored a yes in terms of harming I never really thought of committing suicide but sometimes I think of what if somewhere some truck would just hit my car and Id be in a car accident Going back to tarot reading The reader never answered my question and it became a psychic read where in some spirit comes to talk to you She asked about my dad I said my dad had passed 15 years ago She described how my dad is and telling me about my current situation how I am carrying everything and I need someone to depend on and help me This made me realize that as much as I have a close small group of friends ones whom I trust I really dont have anyone that I can truly depend on 100 like who can I ask money for should I get to an accident etc none My mom and my brother is there but I really dont want them shouldering my problems I also realized that I am not living for anyone but why not live for myself Its just a problematic life and I honestly wont mind if my life ends here It made me realize those people with children having all the will to live because they need and have to If you see me out it looks like Im living such a good life I look good I dress well on weekend I go to brunches I watch musicals opera attend art galleries and eat good food I smile and I laugh but I also dont have money and I live paycheck to paycheck with lots of debts I need to have a thyroid operation which my healthcard cannot pay for fully so I will need to line up on a public government hospital Last year I have a colleague who I used to be friends with We drifted apart because of work which is okay with me because you wont be friends for life with all of your friends some friendships has an expiration date Thats just reality but it seems like groupings have happened at work and its really annoying sometimes In my head thats okay and Ill just work The friend I have in the office also just got retrenched Something happened at work again today and as much as I say I dont care about it as long as I know Im in the right then I dont want to even think about it But I cried and honestly I just want to resign lay in bed look in the ceiling and have my thoughts run around I thought about dying again BUT I cant resign because I dont have a dollar to my name and bills I just need to tough it out until next year,Depression

Hi all24FI have been taking 30mg of nortriptyline since 2015 for general anxiety and to help with some depressionsleep issues It has worked pretty well for me no complaints I have not loved the fact that I cannot drink alcohol much it just intensifies it a lot but other than that I have been able to sleep great and my anxietydepression has been under control the past 6ish years However I am finding it not to be as effective anymore I am not sure why but my anxiety is back lately fluttery feeling constantly just general anxiety for a lot of the days with nothing really provoking it nothing worrying me or anything anxiety inducing in particular Lately I have found it extremely hard to wake up and get out of bed in the mornings and I cannot really drink caffeine either so most mornings I am up around 930 and just feel super tired for a good part of the morningI am considering switching to Celexacitalopram my boyfriend and sister are both on it and they seem to really like it My only concern is that it will affect my sleep I hear it can make it hard to fall asleepstay asleep Another concern is tapering off nortriptyline while introducing a new medication at the same time I am going to talk to my doctor this week about it but just wondered if anyone has any insight on switching or going off nortriptyline Any advice would be appreciated Wanting to switch my medication from Nortriptyline to Celexa Citalopram,Depression

Worried ive had cancer and its progressed too far now undiagnosed I apologize in advance for my sloppy writing Im a 19 year old male and 18 last year when i started experiencing my symptoms It was June or july 2017 and i had been starting to feel tired more often as my senior year ended Nothing shocking since ive always been tired and i was losing sleep over stress of not knowing where i was gonna go for college or how i was gonna spend the summer One day in the summer when i was hanging out with my cousin i became unbareably tired and felt like i was gonna pass out Id describe it just as the feeling of having really low blood sugar I layed in my bed and freaked out because i thought i had something terribly wrong with me my parents didnt take it seriously but instead talked very gently through it with me about how it was probably my anxiety and that did bring me back to feeling somewhat less fatigued after a rational conversation I thought this feeling would go away during that week for sure but i felt fatigued the whole week through Being alone bored fatigued and scared to death that whole week took such a toll on my anxiety and stress levels After that week i started to attempt to move past it getting out and doing more physical things to try to shake it off and to also test that my physicallity wasnt degrading Im not very fit and was never good at running but i wasnt physically diminished at all i could run for just as long and do just as many pushups despite feeling a vague fatigue After that it was on and off but it always came back a sensation if vague fatigue and low blood pressure that would just strike me randomly I went to the doctor a month later and all of my vitals were normal and he brushed it off as anxiety and stress related I also wanted a blood test which returned as completely normal So i was just living like this being constantly fatigued on and off I eventually went back to him in august to try and get more answers but with good vitals yet again he wouldnt listen to my concerns and kept telling me it was psychological I had another blood test which came back completely normal Probably around september i started focusing on my bowel habits and noticed sometimes my food was indigested So i thought hey either colorectal cancer or ibs is behind this I got a stool test done which came back completely normal Now comes the beginning of this year and im still feeling frustrated by my off and on fatigue without any answers so i try talking to a new gastro doctor because im still focused on having colorectal cancer This doctor actually listens to everything i say and he suggests adding fiber to my diet He asks me if i wanted a colonoscopy but i say no because im afraid to have one and we have poor insurance which is possibly the most annoying aspect of this whole thing because whenever i visit the doctor which yields nothing my moms stuck with a bill that almost always goes into collections anyway i voice the concern that i might have celiacs disease because i have many food allergies as it is I get a blood test done in late january checking for sprue and some cancer markers because i voiced my concern Still completely normal and its not celiacs Here we are in march and my worries at an all time high Its literally all i can think about Made so much more troubling by the fact that over the past week ive been off balance on and off This started last week after smoking marijuana right after waking up and having an anxiety attack im scheduled to go to a different doctor for a physical and guidance but the next available spot is fucking april 29th Im so afraid i have some kind of abdominal cancer and its already too far,Anxiety/Stress

Is this health anxiety Or something else Hello all if you take time to read and respond to my post I thank you To begin ive been dealing with health issues since early September about 4 months now Could possibly be lyme or something else but the results were not very cut and dry Ever since these health issss started ive been weighed down by brain fog or at least thats how I describe it to doctors Ive read a bit about brain fog on here but my symptoms seem a bit different could this still be alk anxiety most of my doctors have labled this as my issue My symptoms of what i call brain fog is mainly visual things look and seem a bit offweird not exactly blurry but just off This feeling has been with me before when i had mono 2 years ago but it only lasted about 3 weeks this time has been about 3 months constantly My other symptoms are daily headaches dizzyunstable feeling a feeling or fuzzycongestion in my head not really in sinuses but in head and just feeling out of it I read a lot on this reddit about not being able to remember things or think clearlyconcentrate I dont have these issues mine seem to be mainly visual paired with headaches Is this being caused by my health anxiety If not do you have any ideas Ive had an MRI two CT scans and tons of bloodwork done in the last three months All normal except my lyme came back positive However after antibiotic treatment and still seeing strange results from bloodwork we are thinking it could be a false positive I definitely have anxiety about my health been a rough few months but I feel like of it was anxiety it wouldnt be causing these constant all day symptoms Any help is greatly appreciated Thanks all Any feedback is amazing,Anxiety/Stress

My parents struggled with infertility for 8 years until I was born my brother was born in the next year For the first few years of my life everything was fine At the age of 12 my father started complaining about the expenses for feeding us and how the water and electricity bills were killing him He basically complains everytime he has to buy us dinner or go grocery shopping My mother blames us for forcing her to be a stay at home mom to take care of us And I am like you CHOSE to have us you should have calculated your finances to see whether you could afford to have children BEFORE having us We never asked for you to make sacrifices for us All this could be avoided if you two were just content with being infertile Basically all I am hearing everyday is them complaining about the cost of raising us and all I want to say is buddy I am not overjoyed at being your child either I wished you never had me too How can people be so irresponsible as too not calculate their finances to see if they will be able to afford children and blame everything on the child after having them I have thought that it was my fault when I was young for needing to eat and bathe cuz it cost them money I even stopped eating for a while but now that I am older and I think about it WHAT THE HELL Just do not have me if you cannot afford it Man parents can be so dumb sometimes I got depression cuz of my parents,Depression

I do not know where to start this story but I recently turned 18 and I have spent the past two years mostly unhappy and anxious I hated who I am and where I came from As my dad died when I was nine years old I thought during the past two years he died due to a suicide believing he jumped off a building atleast that was what I was told he fell off a building far away from my house for unknown reasonsI held to this thought for two years and spent countless nights crying through anxiety and panic attacks as well as harming myself to cope Until I got the courage to ask my mom and new stepdad what has happened with my dad regarding more context on how he died Turns out my parents were hiding information from me that he died falling off the balcony of my house because the railing tore off while he was leaning on it I am still not sure if that is the truth but sense then I have never entered my balcony These hardships found their way into my daily life where I found it very hard to interact with people sense I was young altho I desperately wanted someone to interact with This coupled with fact that I am on the autism spectrum did not do me any favors I was bullied relentlessly in high school for rumors spread by bullies of me being gay I am bisexual and awkward I always went home in a bad mood because of this Faking sicknesses and throwing up on purpose so I could miss the next school day to avoid my classmates I spent those days in my room in physical pain because of my panic attacks rather than studying for the classes I missed I was always jealous of people with many friends and especially partners because I was in great physical shape and conventionally attractive I just do not know how to interact with people and I thought having someone to love would solve my issues When COVID19 hit I no longer could go to the gym which was keeping me together in a sense All these issues got worse 10 fold and because of that I began going to abandoned buildings near my area looking down and convincing myself to jump like I thought my dad did and I almost succeeded As a last resort I decided to open up to one of my three close friends on what I was going through and he helped me regain some sanity that I was worth something and I should not be ashamed of what I am All in all I thought I got rid of these thoughts habits and pains more recently I improved my grades got accepted to a great prestigious college and heading towards the future Until one of my friends managed to get a partner I congratulated him but got jealous I began hating myself for being jealous and I am spiraling back down to where I was in the past few weeks I have already missed a few college assignments I need help to cope with these emotions I do not know what to do anymore Lonely Lost and Anxious,Depression

Struggling to discern between anxiety and real symptoms How does anyone manage to deal with health anxiety when you clearly have symptoms of something and it isnt just a general worry about dropping dead from cancer or a stroke A couple of weeks ago I noticed I had air hunger that sensation that you arent getting enough oxygen and I have begun to get vertigo dizzy or lightheadedness quite frequently Here in the UK it is quite hard to get a Drs appointment that isnt an emergency one and I have got one booked in for close to the end of the month The last week has been horrible for me because while realistically as a 29 year old I am not at a huge risk of lung cancer or heart failure and I cannot stop obsessing about how serious this illness could potentially be Especially because it is clearly not a common cold but if it is real maybe a viral infection like labyrinthitis The problem is that the more I worry the more things happen like palpitations stomach ache and such like All classic anxiety symptoms that I am sure are due to my HA but my mind just cannot reconcile that the simplest explanation must be true Its the opposite of how i operate as I am a scientist and normally think very logically In the past I have spoken to the GP about my HA but they dont really seem to do much about it I asked if I could be refereed to someone but instead was told to look up selfhelp related stuff online Weirdly I worry that being labelled as a hypochondriac on my medical records will bias a doctor towards me if I am require treatment Just have no idea how I am going to get through the next few weeks until I can see a GP for a 10 minute lets do nothing and see what happens waste of time,Anxiety/Stress

I have read many posts and have wanted to make one but never got the motivation to do so Today is my birthday a day I hate to celebrate as my life has always been not worth celebrating I am 52 This year in February I had planned to take my own life with insulinsub zero temps and alcohol I had made plans for 34 years and researched an infallible processes that did not involve a firearm I had placed conditions to achieve before I can move forward with said plan 1 First was for my 104 Year old Gma to pass She watched as both of her kids die and bury them She died last year after I was forced to put her in a nursing home due to failing health and many bad falls 2 Pay off my house and have money in the bank I achieved both 3 Encourage my wife to loose some weight and get healthily to find a new guy if she so wanted 4 get my three sons through post high school education and started on their lives 5 Get 100 service connection for my gulf war illnesses that makes my every day life hell 6 All the while to keep it all a secret All tasks were completed until my son diedI feel Justified in my analysis that my life is not worth continuing as I have failed in many aspects of my life among many successes I have achieved From the age of 78 or so I was bullied due to moving around a lot Age 11 is when I began to fantasize about my death by jumping in front of the tires of a full grain truck I even picked fights with upper high school kids who had bullied me while in 6th grade hoping they would kill me did not and do not make friends easily if I did they was close until they betrayed me Now as an adult I tend to have 75 of the people I work with hatedislike me 10 ignore me and 15 value me and appreciate my abilitys as a technician I am a hard driving person who takes the initiative to get stuff done and focus on the highest achievable result Unfortunately many times people are made to look bad in contrast to my results so they become spiteful They then begin a campaign to discredit sabotage or inhibit my efforts to be successful I tend to be resourceful and clever so I usually spitefully get in the hardest licks by using the system or strait out vengeanceI constantly contemplate my success and failure to evaluate how to be more successful socially and feel that since growing up I never got to have real true friends I lost out on learning those skills is my excuse Now I can give a crap Accept me or fuck off kind of dealnow I look at myself as a broken car I have too many things broken I need to go to the Junk yard I am also a Farm kid and I have put down many animals that were in bad shape I am no different I get angry with people who try to convince me I am a human and that I do not work that way or I should not commit suicide Its my life run yours The people who drink too much eat too much or use tobacco never get condemned they are committing slow suicide but that appears to be OK in our societyAfter the Death of my 24 year old son I told my wife about how I felt about my life and was planning to end it We talked and she simply said that she was ashamed she never saw it and was Afraid to be left alone since I was a little girl That was enough for me to remove my suicide plans off the table in the form of a promise Two weeks after I burred my son the 20 F weather I wanted was here But I promised my wife I would not take my own life I am angry as hell about that I deleted friends from FB called people and told them to fuck off as they failed me deleted a gaming clan I ran for 20 years I burned everyone that was close to me so I can suffer even deeper I guess My son suffered from Schizophrenia due to an ATV accident 7 years ago COVID his escalating condition recent death of a close friend his 2 Gmas and great GMA and other factors made him feel like he had no choice but to take his own life with a gun this January I am relieved he is no longer suffering from episodes I am however still suffering and since I failed him I am embracing my daily neuropathic pain chronic migraines and 20 other autoimmune conditions and the harassment I get at work Each day I drive to work hoping I get in an fatal accident to escape this world I feel my situation is for relief not to make a statement or punish anyone or get attention This world is hell Death is my version of heavenI do not know what to expect from this group I hope I am not griefed but also not looking for resolving my feelings I have no outlet for the death of my son no one helps with my harassment and have no friends My wife cannot talk about my son with me so am trapped with no way to progress to a new stage in my life as I never expected to be alive I get counseling at the VA but they are not helpfulIf you made it this far thanks for reading If you have a suggestion or solution please post it A promise prevents my Suicide makes me Angry because my son committed suicide this January,Suicidal

Hello guys I am not even sure if this is the right subreddit for this and sorry for my english in advance but i wanted to tell you how unusual I have felt since 2 days ago Basically since I woke up on Tuesday I have been feeling numb like there is a fog in my brain and i lost interest for activities I normally do and really enjoy like watching moviesThe weirdest thing about it is that I have irrational thoughts about it like literally 3 days ago i was watching old obscure essay films and literally the next day I found myself thinking what is the point of movies they are fake those are actors and I cannot wrap my head around thisAdded to the fact that I have constantly felt tired and sleepy I naturally thought about depression or anxiety but i have never had any of those things before in fact I am usually the cheerup guy in the family and usually find the silver lining even out of the most dark situations that have happened so it is being very sudden and unexplainable nothing has happened in my personal life lately either to justify thisI also thought it might be a side effect of Nasonex that is a corticosteroid nasal spray I have taken since the 8th of July and I have read it has some side effects but in the instructions it does not say anything about psychological effects so i kind of wrote it off Then looking online I have read corticosteroids can actually produce anxiety or depression sometimes but it is very rare So i basically do not know what to believeHas anything like this happened to you beforeThanks in advance Weird symptoms for the past 2 days,Depression

I used to write a lot draw a lot as a kid and now I cannot even have the motivation to open up a blank page Even if I do I have spent my whole life feeling like whatever I create will never be worth anything Everything I write has depression plastered all over it I wish I could create something to escape the dread of living to see another day But nothing I make is worth the time and everything is just a reflection of my sick wish to never wake up I do not know why I even bother to stay alive I feel like I am living selfishly but that means I have to want something to begin with Most days I wake up and stay in bed until I get sleepy enough to shut my eyes again I do not dream often but the peace of knowing I am not entirely there is comforting Then I wake up to emails billing me for being alive I play video games to pass the time it is more of an escape and a way to feel like I did something although in the grand scheme of things it is all a waste of time and money Sometimes playing video games makes me happy Yet I cannot share that happiness to anyone It felt more like a dirty little secret than good news that I am 22 yet I still waste my time and money on something that is worth nothingI do not know why I am writing this tbh I had the thought of ending it all but realistically no method is painless and there is always a chance I will survive whatever I do there is nothing in the future that I have to be alive for All I see is just waking up because I could not sleep maybe for the next few decades I have no one to talk to and as much as I thought I wanted someone that means they would have to suffer with me being whatever this state is It just sucks all around cannot create anything,Suicidal

Recently I have started this internship and moved to this really amazing city an opportunity I have been waiting for one and a half year but unfortunately for me I absolutely hate the work that I have to do Ironically from a general point of view it is really not awful and while I am fully aware of it it still everyday kills me a little more However this internship was my wayout ticket from last year which was one of the worst years of my life we have got sent home from uni my 3rd and last study year became online and I do not think I have ever encountered so much loneliness isolation and dullness like I did during the pandemic in my life Besides work and work again though on my 2 days off I either read or stay in my hotel room Have got absolutely no one to do anything with Go out hangout eat or explore the city and doing all these things by myself just makes me feel even more alone than I am so it seems like that is it that is where my life stops And I am stuck Because even though I feel like I cannot stay here any much longer I know for sure I can not go back home Because as little as I have here I literally do not have anything back home No friends no group no social life absolutely nothing And that makes me feel like I am completely missing out on life at 23 when I should be living my best years gain all these experiences and feel young I feel old and tired and absolutely broken inside I just can not fathom why seemingly I can not have a more active life what is painful is that I am someone to who being active and friendships count a lot and yet no matter what I try or where I end up it is always the same pathetic record me being so on my own and never having friends ever since I have graduated highschool I honestly just do not know what to do anymore Where to go or what to follow but this can not be it it is exhausting feeling and living this way Doing and having nothing and holding back crying almost every day A huge part of why I am so unhappy that is probably even more excruciating is the fact that I am not able to do what I am really passionate about professionally The school I ended up going to was a plan B I have chosen it after already dropping out of another one and deep down even though I was hopeful I have knew I would probably end up here that is the thing about plan Bs is not it I think that is exactly the reason why I am so lost and cannot seem to find my place in this world I have tried so many different things and they all were such a clear reminder that I know I am on the wrong path and that my biggest issue starts from there I have grown up with an immense love and fascination for film and I do not think there is anything that I would want to do more than filmmaking Unfortunately in my homecountry there is no school or even an industry for that and abroad I just simply can not afford to study it is literally the only thing I know in my bones I would be good at it is hard to explain but I just feel it What I am having a hard time with is understanding why is that my socalled professional call if that is literally the only thing I would want to do but cannot It consumes me how much I would want to at least be able to try to do something about it but cannot And accepting whatevers left instead just kills me and clearly even though I have tried and am still trying even these days is not a healthy option Lastly I just want to quickly mention that for some reason even though I love reading books make me feel even worse I have been reading a lot of YA and they all depict a reality I would like to find myself in All the laughs all the friends all the parties and crushes are exactly the elements I am missing and have always been missing from my life And this is exactly why I feel like I do not belong I feel things differently Maybe I just feel more People nowadays are so shallow and to me valuing things being genuine and having genuine connections is still so important I have got so much life in me and things I would want to do places I would want to visit but here I am Maybe I am just delusional maybe I have highfunctioning depression I have been thinking about therapy a lot but I just know that it is not going to magically give me neither friends nor the career and life I would like to have I just feel like I am not right for this world I honestly do and even though I am not suicidal and I would never do anything to harm myself death seems like such an easy way out As if tomorrow I would be told I have a terminal disease it would give me a twisted purpose because for the first time in my life I would know where everything is headed to This one and a half year for some reason I can not begin to tell you how much I have thought of that Anyhow thank you a lot for taking time to read this if you got to this point any advice is much appreciated I think I am never actually going to have a life or find my place in this world,Suicidal
I cheated lied and hurt people near and dear to me Now everyone knows my lies and I do not feel like breathing walking or looking anyone in the eyes My spouse cheated on me a long time ago after which things became pretty good She was nice to me worked her way to get me back and make me love her Which I did for about 34 years and then I started feeling the urge to have someone else in my life and see what it feels like to be with someone else than my wife I went down the worse path I lied to someone about my marriage being in turmoil and how I still feel neglected by my spouse I started giving more time to the affair over calls and WhatsApp instead of providing the necessary time to my wife and daughter Recently everyone found out about this as the woman I was involved with was talking to me while her husband was home Now her husband informed everything to my wife I am constantly trying to say sorry and ask for forgiveness My wife is talking to the other women and she is providing more details about what I used to say and not During this affair sometimes I will feel weird about patching up with my wife but will stop myself and withdraw myself because I used to feel it was unjust to her while I am in another relationship To touch her kiss her or even say I loved her I am this horrible human being and I feel I dont deserve any of them Now I have a hard time just living let alone working I wish my wife forgives me I tried talking her into marriage counseling but her point is you have mental issues why should she suffer Cant look into my daughters eyes she doesnt know anything Same with Mom My only support system in the world after I lost my dad this year was my brother He knows everything about this now and is withdrawn from me and anyway he lives in a different country I will be ok living alone too I mean I will understand if my wife leaves me now She has not decided anything yet But to stay like this its difficult do I have a right to live Is there any hope for a monster like me Please help if you think I am still worth living and loving,Depression

Physical abuse wise my dad had beat me several times I never really understood that it was abuse until not that long ago things like hitting my legs together what seemed like as hard as he could hitting me on the face as hard as he could threatening to choke me out etc it overall made me feel pretty disassociated I just didnt really understand why though my relationship with my parents became this extremely hollow thing that felt like an obligation rather than having genuine parents as I got older from 10 on they became increasingly mentally abusive on top of it at age 11 my dad found out that Im trans by looking on my computer and screamed at me for an hour and threatened to hospitalize me He didnt know mental hospitals wont hospitalize people for it and mightve ended up trying to put me into conversion therapy or something this is around where my mental health completely snapped going into 7th grade hitting age 12 I started becoming extremely suicidal I thought about hanging myself at school or stabbing myself it became too much to bear not being able to be openly trans being beaten feeling on edge non stop feeling completely invalidated to the core of who I am as a person I became morbidly depressed and stayed that way from then on,Anxiety/Stress

I find it so frustrating as a highly anxious and depressed person to do career tests because they rely on your passion for specific activities and I find myself answering I dislike it very much to the various questions eg working in construction healthcare finance whatever Ive been trying to get back to work again because it seems my severe depression and anxiety wont go away and there is only so much medication and therapy can help me Of course I havent tried every kind of therapy but what had been offered to me at low cost But Ive tried many medications Anyhow I feel very frustrated because after trying couple of online part time jobs like writing marketing stuff on websites and finding myself not motivated enough to work sufficient hours to make ends meet Im trying to start from zero again and do some career tests to find what motivates me But those tests dont offer some magical information but just rely on what youre passionate about Like they give you 50 questions and ask you how much you like doing different activities like installing cabinets diagnosing disease in people giving financial advice to someone wanting to get a loan helping a disabled person get dressed playing a musical instrument in front of an audience taking care of sick animals etc etc etc I hate them ALL None of these activities excite me Because having a job is always about what others expect of you But mental illness sucks so much of your energy that there is so little left for the job Like if Im a cashier my high anxiety and depression and the various thoughts and emotions and physical symptoms I experience will take so much of my energy to control and nothing left to put on a smile and make a customer feel welcome and at the same time do my job of scanning items very quickly and correctly Thats why Ive been trying to find jobs that are just online and things I can do on my own time so that whenever the damned mental health issues give me a break then I can do the job The problem is there are too many people doing these jobs and they pay so little that Ive had to start looking at other options Damn it I dont know what I want to hear from you to be honest I mean I already am so filled with selfhatred and hatred for the world I am working myself into anger just writing about it,Anxiety/Stress

Hey I am diagnosed with depression anxiety and some other stuff After my new meds and good psychologist I am doing better since 8 years It feels great but I find it a scary process because of the relapses I have had in the past so I do not want to jinx it by being overly positive about it What I am struggling currently is the physical and mental toll good days are giving me afterwards it is not as bad as my depression days but it just makes me feel fatigued in a different way For example I would have maybe 5 good days in a year and now I am having maybe 3 a month sometimes more So it is an massive improvement but the thing is I get so damn tired after a few good days and just crash My body feels just heavy and slow Its like my body cannot process all these positive emotions and just is not used to it working differently it is as if my brain is saying happy times up and then shuts off Is it just my brain getting used to all the serotonin and needs time to adjust Does anyone relate to this Is this normal going through recovery Drained after a good day can anyone relate,Depression

I live with two people in my family who have schizophrenia and there was a butcher knife placed on a picture of me im a 19 year old cc student and i live with my grandma mom uncle aunt and little sister my mom has a meth addiction and shes developed schizophrenia from it and its been getting worse as the years go on my uncle was hit on the head at a young age and im not exactly sure what he struggles since we never talk but i think its schizophrenia my mom doesnt take her meds i think and my grandma is constantly trying to help her with moving in and out of motels and rehabs and all this stuff for the past 8 months or so realistically shes been trying to help her for many many years now but my mom had moved out recently my mom moved back in like a week ago my uncle is very strange and i dont know really anything about him he leaves his room a few times a day and doesnt talk to anyone sometimes i hear him talk to himself in his room but he doesnt yell and scream like my mom does hes just very quiet and intense so earlier tonight i was using my grandmas phone for school since mine was dead and i got curious to look in her messages between my mom because ive seen messages between them before where my mom is talking about how she hears voices talking about someone wanting to kill me and how shes constantly was thinking about me and she doesnt think im safe so i looked and my aunt shes mentally well sent my grandma a picture where she found a big butcher knife placed on top of a picture of me the message said uncles name is acting strange again i asked moms name if she did this and she said she didnt does uncles name know what it means to stab someone that they will die in the photo my aunt sent my grandma the picture of me was in like a mouse pad that was custom made with a photo of me from 4th grade the thing is im not sure if its a coincidence because the mouse pad is on a desk for like where a computer used to be but the desk in like directly connected to the kitchen like almost next to it so it could be possible that someone had happened to place that knife there so i didnt really freak out but i talked to some friends and when i kinda said it out loud to them i did kinda realize like damn that does kinda sound bad and they told me that yea its probably not safe i dont know if it was my uncle or mom either though if it even was intentional my uncle used to come home and hit me in the head as a kid a lot and we would yell and scream at each other we lived together for like 6 years and this would happen then we moved then we moved again and he moved back in with us but ever since we moved back in again we literally do not talk to each other at all hes very awkward around me and everyone tbh and quiet and i can tell he doesnt like to be in the same room as me even though i do not interact with him at all whatsoever weve said hey to each other like less than 10 times over the years and thats about it he does kinda seem like he hates me but i dont think he would want to kill me on the other hand its possible that my mom was lying to my aunt but from what ive seen i dont think my mom wants to kill me either whenever she has talked about me in that way its more of a this is my son i need to protect him from whoever gonna kill him type of way rather than a malicious tone but again they are both schizophrenic which i really dont know much about besides they can be unpredictable and so thats why im asking i know its weird to ask about this on reddit but i really dont have anyone to talk to about it im not going to directly confront my uncle about it because again we are very distant and hes a big guy i just dont want to i feel like itd be worse and i dont want to ask my mom because i know she would say no even if she did im going to ask my grandma tomorrow since i havent been able to since shes been asleep all night but shes just going to ignore me after i express my concerns which she always does i can talk to my aunt about it even though were not really too close but yeah another thing is my grandma sent the photo my aunt sent her to my uncle asking if he did it and he kind of just ignored it didnt deny it so but yea i cant really move out or anything i dont have the money for that since i just graduated high school and honestly i dont have a job right now since im a full time student and i just dont know where i would go i dont have any friends that would let me live with them either so thats out of the picture the best thing im hoping for is the convince my grandma to have them move out but thatll probably never happen even though i want it to so bad i just dont know if this is a coincidence with the knife and i shouldnt be worried or what i should do so yea pls help,Anxiety/Stress

Its been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday Just had their bags packed and said I am leaving I have no closure and still do not even know what happened She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels I do not know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me Now I am a waste of life in their 30s with no reason to live She took all my friends with her and I just do not have anyone anymore I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out but was quickly reminded why I do not spend much time with my family as its only made my mental health worse I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything I have stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily which I had not done for a year really I took my last Ativan today and its been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me I think for some people suicide is their lifes purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that But I cannot even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself I just do not understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me its time to die I do not expect any one to respond or even read this I just have no one Cry for help,Suicidal

When I am by myself with my thoughts I always start feeling really sad and lonely and depressed I am an introvertor ambivert and I love being alone but there is also always a part of me that feels like something is missing and then I get depressed and anxious So far in the summer I have been pretty busy with my internship and hanging out with friends which means I felt this feeling less than before summer started This for a moment made me feel that maybe my mental health was improving However I finished my internship last week and this week I am spending more time at home and less time with friends My plan was to get school work donebecause of procrastination I have not but idk I have began feeling sad again for no reason I think its because I do not have the distraction of hanging out with people anymore to ignore my thoughts Does anyone feel this too Any suggestions to stop Feeling sad and lonely and depressed for no reason,Depression

ever since my girlfriend moved 0 minute away to college i find myself worrying that she s in danger or dead when i don t hear from her for a while i m still a senior in highschool during the day i m usually not worried about her safety but at night if i don t hear from her by the time i m going to bed at like 0 pm i start to agonize and worry that she s dead she doe taekwondo every evening until or 9 and then take a 0 minute trip from the dojo back to her dorm and if i don t hear from her by the time i go to bed i start to lose sleep over my anxiety this happens any time i have a reason to expect to hear from her and i don t she assures me that the school campus is safe and i have nothing to worry about she s also a very safe driver and she s tall and athletic and therefore probably difficult to kidnap but i hate to think about that i could ask her to check in with me more or to check in at certain time but i feel strongly against being overbearing or controlling and i don t want to cross her boundary i think it annoys her a little bit already how much i worry about her and how i panic if i don t hear from her but she also try to reassure me the best she can i can t seem to ever fight my anxiety with logic i only feel better after hearing from her i don t feel this way when i m with her and i didn t even feel this way when we lived in the same town but in different house any advice on how to stop worrying so much about her safety,Depression

For the last couple of weeks I have been having very distressing intrusive thoughts A lot of these thoughts revolve around the fear of being attracted to children A few weeks ago me and my partner were watching a documentary about peodophile hunters and my brain started wondering about the physical side of it what it is like to do something like that and how can they even do it I was very uncomfortable with these thoughts and felt guilty and horrible I told my partner and he told me it was nothing to worry about I still felt guilty Over the next couple of weeks I started having intrusive thoughts about it while going about my daily life I have been doing an online course about safeguarding children in preparation for my future career and during the course I kept having very distressing thoughts about how they deserve it or seeing images of the abuse happening in my head It made my already existing OCD 100x worse and I struggled to complete the course What topped it off today wasI had a nap because I do not sleep very well I had this very long intrusive thought while sleeping I do not want to call it a dream because that implies it was something enjoyable and it was far from it I had this long intrusive thought about me and an older girl doing something with a younger girl in my bedroom at home I have no idea what age the girl was but she was young We ended up getting caught and my life was over I woke up unable to breathe I felt sick I felt guilty I felt disgusted I wanted to claw my brain out of my head it is 3 hours later and I still feel that way I cannot deal with thinking things like that But I cannot reach out for help because if I do everyone is going to think I am a pedophile My future will be destroyed I am not a pedophile I would never do anything to harm a child I do not understand what is happening to me I am already very mentally unwell I have chronic anxiety depression I was physically emotionally abused as a child and neglected I have been sexually assaulted I am dealing with a lot Maybe it is all of that causing it I do not know but I can live with all of that but I cannot live with this I plan to kill myself at 6pm I am going to get a taxi as close to the bridge in town as I can and throw myself off I have thought about that for months as a good way to go and now I finally have a good enough reason to use it disturbing intrusive thoughts are ruining my life and I cannot live with them,Suicidal

Sorry in advance if some sentences do not make any sense as I am not a native speaker Most of my english comes from memes and series I am 25 years old male big loser with no education and living in a shit hole I have been depressed since I have been concious and the pain has been gradually increasing to a point that I feel like I cannot take it anymore My father was not present when I was a kid and because my mom had to take care of me alone she overworked herself so she could sustain her kid The absence of my father and mother in my life hurted me a lot and while I despise my father for leaving my mom when she was pregnant I can totally understand why she was absent and trying to give me a decent life to her best efforts I was physically abused by my babysitter on a daily basis It was very hard for me to articulate to my mom what she was doing and this ended when a friend of my family witnessed what she was doing to me one day After that I started living alone in our house because my mom could not trust anyone else to take care of me this was when I was 9 yo At my 11 years of age I was sexually abuse by a woman that was 4 years older than me The experience was very traumatic and sex has always been very difficult since then All of my romantic relationships have ended in abandonment from my partner and I wonder if the sexual abuse that I suffered earlier has to do with that I deserted my undergrad Mechatronics because I was scared of failing again in life and running always seemed easier and safer I deeply regret this now that I am older but it is too late to go back Now I am stuck in a third world country with a very high crime rate and extreme poverty with no education no good jobs prospects nothing I was very close to end my life a few days ago but my current girlfriend decided to call me randomly and I broke down into tears and told her everything and she convinced me to not do it I have never tried suicide before but that day I was completely commited to end my life violently and for good My current relationship is long distance she is in another country with an ok job and is on her way to become a permanent resident Because of my lack of education and preparation it is almost impossible for me to go to where she is We met when we were younger in the current country that I live in and we had a relationship but she left me for reasons that I did not know back then and then we reconnected few months ago and we are together again yea I know that this was a very bad decision I have decided that I am going to ilegally inmigrate to a first world country and gamble my life there My options are limited and I fucking hate life so why not This was a decision I made before I got into this relationship but now that I am compromised with someone and realised that there is no way in hell we could be together because she would have to leave everything just to live together with a good for nothing It really sounds ridiculous She says that she is deeply in love with me and would do anything to be together I feel like what is going to happen is that she is going to realise that she had to sacrifice a lot for an unknown future with someone that is a loser and will end up hating me I also deeply love her and I do not think I could forgive myself ever I want to end my life I do not think I can fix my situation and even so the temptation of killing myself will ever go away I am so sorry for my mother that had a very rough life and it seems that I am about to just make it more miserable for her I hope that my mother girlfriend and friends could forgive me but maybe that is asking for too much I definitely do not deserve any of that Thank you for reading my story Am at my wits end Thinking about death feels like peace,Suicidal

I have struggled with depression suicidal thoughts for years now and my husband knows this He has been very supportive when I started therapy and medication and continues to be there for me However we had a fight and rather than telling me he needed a break from the discussion he just walked away from me we later discussed it and he did not want to start yelling so he chose to remove himself from the situation communication is a separate thing that we are working on At a certain point I seriously considered hanging myself from our weight lifting cage I went so far as to toss a a belt over the chin up bars I do not really know why I stopped Maybe realizing that it was not tall enough for the belt or that I did not know how to secure it properly From there I just had a series of thoughts about how long it would take for him to come down and check on me how he would react what would happen if it failed So I went back upstairs and told him that I needed help I do not think he realizes how close I was to going through with it and I do not know how to approach it He also struggles with depression so I do not want to put blame on him He may have upset me but I have an illness that does not let me think or process emotions rationally in times of stress Right now I am thinking about writing a letter so I can get my thoughts ordered and give it to him but that feels immature Weak I do not know just not right Advice on how to approach this would be helpful Side note My doctor and I agreed to increase my antidepressant dose and I have an appointment with my therapist scheduled for next week So some steps have already been taken to prevent this from happening again How to talk about how close I was to going through with it my husband,Suicidal

Anxiety developing over Texts Some background Im currently 18 and I was the girl who had a big group of friends who genuinely didnt hate each other and kept in touch last semester of High school I lost touch and lost many friends even my two friends of 4 years I did get diagnosed with panic disorder but I also know panic attacks arent the only thing I get and I can develop anxiety over many things I started dating a guy early in 2022 and towards the end I had started getting anxious over texts and even looking at iMessage itself sometimes then I developed some anxiety and shakiness when I wouldnt hear back from him for a long time It was a dark time for me and I noticed I started getting anxious and was having bad thoughts about myself Now I met this new guy probably a week after I broke it off with my ex and hes great were not dating but definitely exclusive but from 5pm 9pm he doesnt message me for a long time and I understand hes eating dinner wants alone time for his own things but I hate having this shakiness in my hands and it feels like a rock weighing me down and Im shaking everywhere all over my body like I cant move Sometimes I think the solution is to tell him hey can you text me back in x amount of time or I dont like how you dont message me for awhile sure short term solution but I know things will come up and hell eventually resent me for making him do that and this goes way beyond him as well Even if we break things off in the future I dont want to have major anxiety over the next guy and go through these feelings again and again and I want a permanent solution Help,Anxiety/Stress

Stress Management Stress management is new to me I have several diagnoses and am being treated by a psychiatrist and a therapist Ive been on short term disability for 3 months now due to migraine complications After several images and tests the neurologist sums my condition up to excessive environmental stresses which brought on medical predispositions such as occipital neuralgia with chronic migraine disorder I also recently stopped drinking alcohol Ive been on bed rest for the past few months and after a recent procedure to prevent migraines my neurologist has cleared me to return to work in 2 weeks I wont bore anyone with the details of my stresses these past months but at 44 I can truly say this is the most stress Ive experienced in my life to the point that my body gave up I need a good program on how to manage my stress if Im going to be able to live my life So Im reaching out here asking if anyone has found a good program and wouldnt mind sharing it Im also going to AA meetings and am in the early stages of that 12 step program Thanks,Anxiety/Stress
I didnt have the courage to go to an event bc of anxiety I was supposed to go to a pub crawl event this evening but got cold feet right before the event started and now Im sad disappointed and alone at my home The first three hours before the event I was feeling okay and so sure I would be going but slowly the panic started to kick in And I ended up shaking and crying while changing my clothes and getting ready for the evening And then I just gave up It sucks I really wanted to go the event sounded like a blast and I already bought the ticket It all came crashing down when I realised that I dont know anyone from the event and that I had to make the effort of meeting new people there alone I thought I could be brave and go to that place alone because none of my friends didnt want to come with me I have gone to events before alone and it has been fine in the end even if I was super anxious about going there beforehand I guess today was just not my day,Anxiety/Stress

Ive had anxiety for a few years Im seventeen and only got diagnosed properly like 7 months ago alongside depression Over the past few months Ive developed a stutter and Ive been unable to form proper sentences which has given me a fear of talking to friends and even just talking in general Im not the smartest person in my family and have got the lowest grades but Ive always been excellent with my literacy but when Im talking to either my family or friends the words just cant come out Ive recently had something happen to nw where I was used for comedy told to try electro shock therapy to help my mental illnesses by some guy pretending to be there for me This is only really related because this has made me really antisocial and I cant trust people anymore,Anxiety/Stress
I know this is not that bad of a situation compared to other peoples posts but I feal like this might help me Since late April i had been desperate about getting a gf I knew the perfect person we have known each other for 3 years now as friendsI was officially in love with her the reason why I loved her so much is because my life was perfect when was around her At this point i did not care about looks or other things related to that i wanted someone to suport me and help me go through the final exam i had this year From random conversations we had she always said that she might have a relation ship with someone So I waited and waited until it was all over with school At the start of the month i was talking with some friends about her they told me to shoot my shot One day we were out together for context in our neighborhood there are only 4 teens in the same age range we were all 4 out just to hang out My crush was with her best friend and me and another dude like 2 years younger than me just talking At this point a had enough i call my homie and ask him for help we both knew jack shit about relationships we barely talked to girls So he adds to the call a friend of his that was i class with us a girl shocking i know I told her everything even tho she was drunk and we agreed to tell her So I left the call and talk with the kid that was with me After some time my crush and her best friend go next to us and ask wydidk just talking i said And out of nowhere she said about what Out of pure stress i told her that i like her and she said that she sees me as her friend From that day on life is dark meaningless to me i feel like life is not fun in fact i have not heard a word from the since I still have fealings for her and those are just demolishing mental health The internet does not help ever since I searched for help on it my feeds on all social media apps are people getting gf and post photos of them cuddling If the is a god ten why does all bad things fall on me please i just wanted to be happy again and it is even worst Is it to much to ask for,Depression

In the past 2 months we were constantly arguing starting again for a week then arguing again and again it is got to a point where she told me that everything I said annoyed her But now we are good again we are finally texting somewhat as we used to and began to see each other again I had a mental breakdown one night and I told her that I would give everything just so it could be as it was before we started arguing she said that it will not happen again and that I need to get over it I must note important I note that we were not dating at least not officially she never wanted a relationship but we spent many nights together and she called it something between friends and a relationship Now to the reason I do not believe we are done First off it is the second time she said we will be just friends and that she does not see anything more of it but still we ended up another two months being together after that After she drunkenly told me that she too feels something to me but she is afraid so she lied to me she does not feel anything And the second reason is that even though she told me we will be just friends she still comes over to my house on the same day she told me there will be nothing more to us and cuddle with me all night So what do you think Do I have a reason to not believe her in this or should I accept we are done She told me we will not be anything but friends again but I cannot get myself to believe her Is it justified by my side or am I just in doubt,Depression

Eating Beets Red Stool I had a fairly large amount of cut up beets for lunch today around noon along with a small cup of beet lemonade Around 5pm my stool had quite a reddark pink tint to it and the toilet water was that color as well It is now 830 and I have gone again same result I am aware that beets can discolor your stool however 5 hours seems pretty fast I thought it normally takes food upward of 24 hours to go from being consumed to being excreted Am I worried for nothing This has never happened before and I have eaten beets before but never quite as much as I did today Thanks in advance,Anxiety/Stress

I am thinking calmly and rationally about this now I am feeling more detached from the two friends I have and unable to open up because it has had negative outcomes and now I am too scared And I realize the greater distance I have from them the easier it is to let myself leave this world It would be better for everyone too I promise I have been causing a lot of stress and overwhelm with horrible depressive episodes that just have not gotten better over four years despite much treatment I genuinely believe it is just better for me to go at this point I have run out of options I am tired of trying I am tired of feeling alone I cannot think of any reasons not to die anymore I think the best thing would be for me to die,Suicidal

last night i had a dream that ha been weighing on my mind all day long even now a i prepare for bed i cant shake the memory of it and i fear that it will be revisited in more horrible way than before the love of my life stephanie is traveling home with two of her male friend from a party their car is forced off the road by a pair of car and armed men jump out and pull them from their vehicle the friend are brutally executed with a hail of gunfire and stephanie covered in their sticky blood is forced into the trunk of one of their car pleading with the men she is taken to a dark place and sold a an object and she becomes the victim of human trafficking for 0 year i pine for my lost love a i wonder about her disappearance and out of the blue i learn of her fate and also her whereabouts i go to the gun store she is being held in and spy her in a back room chained inside a cage her form battered and bedraggled and only a sliver of her once beautiful form remaining i make pleasantry with the men behind the counter a i surreptitiously draw from my pocket a blade asking for the price of an item on the shelf behind him i draw the attention of one of the men away from me making him turn around when his back is turned i take my knife and swiftly slit his throat throwing his gagging body to the floor with shocked look on their face the other two men in the store watch a i bound over the counter and stab the first of them to death through his chest with a leap across the room i take hold of the last of them and we struggle furiously a he force the blade from my hand causing it to clatter to the floor we fight ferociously and eventually i best my foe caving in his skull with a piece of furniture and pulling the cage key from his pocket covered head to toe in gore i unlock stephanie s cage and help her to freedom she look at me like i m some fresh hell being visited on her but i reveal myself for who i am and tell her that she is rescued she burst into tear of relief and sob for hour over all the horrible thing she ha been forced to do and to witness for year nearly uncounted and i console her until she is calmed i produce for her a pair of cupcake that i had prepared before entering the store and had set aside i tell her that the first is made of sugar and apple and is all the sweet thing i will give to her the second is made of coffee and rat poison and will taste bitter but will be the end of her suffering at long last i give her the choice and without a moment hesitation she take the latter and eats heartily of it sending the former to the floor forgotten she smile a wan grin at me and tell me thank you before closing her eye and looking finally at peace with her lot i hold her in my arm to keep her warm and safe a she pass on into the next world unable to live with what ha happened to her in her captivity at this point i awoke and stared at the pillow beneath me and imagined all the terrible thing that stephanie must have experienced and for a long moment i wa horrified it wa only then that the realization that it wa a dream hit me and i remembered the truth stephanie ha been dead for fifteen year she took her own life in a fit of depression and did not in fact fall victim to human trafficking at this realization i said aloud i m glad you killed yourself with an unspoken underscore of this realization that she hadn t been sold a thought that in no way ha ever formed in my mind or lip before that moment writing out this account already make me feel better and i think i might be able to brave another round of unconsciousness though i have no doubt another mare of the night will visit this is my first reddit posting and i thank you for reading it,Depression

I am 16 I failed 10th grade because of struggling with online school and now I am on probation for truancy for 6 months That really is not that big of an issue for me because I can pass the drug tests and I am a mostly behaved kid My parents are divorced and they do not get along at all I see my dad maybe 23 times a month and its only ever for a few hours He beat me once when I was young and I had a horrible stepmom who neglected me and verbally abused me for years He never got in trouble as my mom did not press charges but that and my stepmom basically ruined our relationship I have a girlfriend with severe depression and anxiety issues I will not go into specifics for her sake but Ill just say her alcoholic father caused a lot of her trauma This girl means the world to me and I want her for as long as I am alive but i just do not know anymore She smokes weed and vapes and it kills me to watch it I always try to convince her to stop but she says you know what you signed up for When I try to talk about it she makes me out as the bad guy every time It genuinely crushes me like nothing else All but 1 of her friends are what Id consider addicted to weed and nicotine and they are horrible influences I try to tell her she needsdeserves better friends and then she calls me controlling I truly am not controlling I just want the best for her Her mom and I have discussed it and she agrees with me Idk it just feels like I am trapped but do not want to escape I just got my first job at Kohls and i get paid 10hour more than minimum wage so I feel like I should be happy but honestly I just do not care I feel like my life is just running on repeat Same bs day after day and I am so tired I do not have the guts to end my life but I just want it to stop I feel lost and alone and like nothings worth it anymore,Suicidal

Is the stress of my international sales job worth the benefits Looking for guidance Hi Im a sales director who recently received a promotion to build and lead a new sales operation for an Australian media company in a foreign country After relocating my family and settling into our new home I found the job to be manageable albeit stressful for the first 89 months However after a year Ive realized that the stress has become a part of my daily routine and its starting to change my personality Im experiencing burnout feeling completely drained unmotivated and even depressed at times I report to upper management located overseas who may not fully understand the realities of building a new operation in a foreign country Despite being expected to do more with less the results are still expected Im struggling to decide if I should push through this or throw in the towel On one hand the benefits of international experience such as building and managing a team in a new market and exploring new commercial initiatives are invaluable On the other hand the stress is taking its toll and Im not sure if its worth it I would appreciate any advice from those who have been in similar situations or know someone who has It can be quite isolating and I lack a trusted network of experienced expats to turn to for guidance Thank you in advance for your help,Anxiety/Stress

He cries every day The first thing he always talks about when he wakes up is how much he wants to die and wishes he did not wake up everyday without fail For months he is said everyday has made him want to die more than the last Hes begged me to kill him so hand him poinson while bawling so hard on the floor he cannot get up to get it himself He said you would be mercy killing me He cannot go to a mental hospital for various reasons we are both minors I am emancipated hes not living alone together and he has quite a long time before he becomes an adult with controlling over his own life His mom neglects him and refuses to give him the medical help he needs despite his therapist telling her how at risk he is for suicide she will not allow him to transition we are both transgender and he feels like nothing could ever make him see the light through the dark Not even me Not even smoking weed helps him anymore because he does not even get stoned anymore and that is the only thing that slows his thoughts and eases his ptsd On top of that were financially struggling and we cannot afford to keep buying weed but if I do not keep buying I risk coming home to find my boyfriend dead I would reach out to authorities and ask him to be helped but we live in a rural bible belt community that would surely make things worse rather than better for him He recently told me next time you go back to work I am going to do it I can give anymore Its too painful All of our friend manipulate us and we cannot trust them It took me days of spending every second bwside him to assure him I would not be ask okay as he thinks I would be if he was not here He told me its going to be okay when I am gone do not be sad please move on and be happy He feels so alone like he only has me And it took the risk of getting fired and losing the house to make him promise me I would not come home to a corpse I told him I could not go back to work until I knew I know he still wants to die more and more every day and he cries more and more every day about the pain of being alive and reliving his trauma and worrying about everything and feeling so out of place and uncomfortable amd burdening in any situation hes placed in I do not care how worn out and exaughsted I am only sleeping one hour a night making sure he does not kill himself I love him and I need him But I know its selfish to keep him here under so much suffering I feel its comparable to watching somome go through chemo without hope of even going into remission knowing they are going to die in pain and just wanting for that day to come But I need you in my life But I need my life to be over to feel any sense of peace He tells me it follows him into his sleep He cannot escape the PTSD and the trauma and the thoughts and his therapist treats him like a kid so they do not do sessions anymore because all she talks about is school which is another reason he wants to die He does not see any positives to living and it is rare for me to come up with ideas that actually make him feel better He never feels better for more than a few minutes at a time Hes been through depressive episodes before but none that have been this harsh and long ever I have never seen or heard of anyone who seems to be living in such a constant state of agony He craves the pain of death because to him it is an answer to his prayers of escape I do not know what to do anymore I feel like it is only a matter of time before I loose him and he keeps telling me that too there is no adults who can help him now atleast not in the situation hes in I just need to know what to say or do I need to know that I am doing the right thing by keeping him alive even though I can tell it tourchers him to be conflicted about hurting me and hurting more each day Am I doing the wrong thing Sometimes it feels like I am Please help I do not know how to help my boyfriend What should I do,Suicidal

I turn 21 next week Male Most of my life is pretty goodI am apart of a loving familyI am very confident and content with the person I am I get along with people well including my family I am also happy with the path I am on in life Well At least most of the timeAbout once a year since I was 14 for a few weeks typically around my birthday I get pretty intense anxiety about my ageThis leads me to a depressive episode and a full blown existential crisis I start obsessing and fearing over my age the future and the past I constantly look around and think about everyone elses age I loose all interest in my goals and hobbies As everything starts to become trivial I get near a panic attack anytime I think of my current age or my age next year After a few weeks I tend to go back to normal but it always comes back and there is always a little bit of it occasionally popping up in my mindI am afraid as I get older It will only get more intense Again most of the time I do not feel this way and sometimes I feel really excited for the future But This annual bout of depressionanxiety can really take a toll on me and my comfort with going forward in life No one else I know seems to have these same feelings no matter what age they are they seem to be just carelessly going about life they might mention something occasionally like wow time flies or something but they do not seem to have the same crippling obsessive fear of the passage of time Does anyone else have similar feelings and possibly grow out of it Or find some sort of peace with the universe Thanks much love and best wishes to everyone DepressionAnxiety over age,Depression

My view on the world and myself has been disturbingly warped since I watched Atomic Black Pill videos That virtually all Women reserve themselves for the top 10 of Men practically worshiping them I am not going to go in too much detail as I already posted about it on Reddit and there is plenty of videos on the subject on YouTube This newly found perspective absolutely destroyed my mind self image and will to live I only see four paths I can take from here on out all options would create a personal Hell either way I can let it corrupt my mentality body and soul and instead of my life being fueled by my now dead aspirations dreams love wonder faith in a better tomorrow I instead function on pure hate The hate in my heart will burn hot enough to get me through everyday life and to actually complete goals reaching all types of success The hate will overpower my desire to be loved hence surviving without it This is the route I have been taking the past week and it works surprisingly well better than any other thing I tried in years The only thing is I will lose my sense of self lose my humanity and over time die inside I noticed taking this route I am perceived as the bad guy and people root for my demise which admittedly makes me feel worse Maybe the Me VS The World mentality will make me comfortable being full of spite at this point it is survivalAnother option I can see is to accept defeat and continue living the rest of my life how I do now Lonely suffering so much emotional pain and lack of motivation that I can barely get up to brush my teeth Completely devoid of my old passions like gaming and watching movies which leaves me stranded on the couch facing the wall most of the day feeling disgusting and depressed This is the most brutal route and the most sufferable This is my last resort if the other two options fail My third option of the three is to kill myself I tried it once or twice before but always failed admittedly I was less knowledgeable of suicide techniques back then Now I barely have the will to go all the way through with it anymore but my new plan is to start taking illegal drugs like Xanax to numb my pain I will deliberately get addicted and more numb until I find myself able to take 10 to 30 all at once I heard this is a peaceful way to pass away definitely so if you listen to your favorite songs as you overdoseThe final option is to do what society expects me to do Shut up and accept my role as inferior eventually killing off my bad genes Accept that since I am average looking I am simply a background character To just stop fidgeting and whining and getting in the main cast solo shots Only associate with other background characters and accept I deserve less get off my high horse like Women has told me I know people will disagree with my beliefs and maybe dismiss me as playing victim but I am trying my very absolute best to be as transparent as possible I seriously do not see any other way and I want help Try to be understanding if you think there is something I am missing or there is something else please share If you want to mercilessly bash me feel free to If you think I am a whining pussy go ahead and tell me Seriously any third person insight will be extremely helpful and nurturing to my character developmentIf you want to just down vote and move along or not even acknowledge my existence in the first place I am comfortable with that as well Worst case scenario I document my struggles and experiences so if I do make that final leap and I am gone my loved ones will be able to google search my name and they will see these strings of subreddit posts No matter what path I choose I always lose,Depression
Are we in Hell In order to survive in this world we must murder and devour another life form plant animal insect We have forgotten this because now other people do that for us but we cannot survive unless we do that So if god is so much loving as he claims to be why would he create such an horrible place where we all have to kill each other to survive Plus why is life so cruel for so many of us This system only favor a few at the top and the rest are thrash basically And look who are the richest people alive All of them are assholes who built their fortune by exploiting dirt cheap labor in under developed countries It feels like the only way to come on top of the food chain is to be the ultimate asshole And the last thing if we somehow disagree with this system and do not want to be part of it the only way out seems to be suicide which is a very painful and traumatic way to end it So most of us hate this place but we stay alive because suicide is very painful and traumatic And really who knows if the pain stops after death Because that is another thing we do not even know why we are here and what is next Are we in Hell,Suicidal

I have been struggling with depression and social anxiety for the past 10 years For the past 3 years it has caused me to struggle with anhedonia more regularly and it has been getting worse lately I am in my midtwenties and I already feel like I have missed out on so many experiences and opportunities in life especially those that are fun A lot of people have said I am too serious and I need to learn how to loosen up and let go Unfortunately I cannot seem to do that with alcohol or drugs I am nervous that I might start increasing start relying on them to feel alive and have let loose Recently I started going to therapy and I have been wanting to go out and try something fun but due to anhedonia it is difficult for me to find something that is fun for me to do I was also a little sheltered growing up which does not help either My parents were helicoptery and devout Christians so a lot of activities that others may consider okayfun is hard for me to enjoy or partake in without an immense amount of guilt and shame I often find myself searching in Google what do people do for fun to find out what other people who are not depressed find fun or fulfilling Many of those activities do not resonate with me What do you all think What do people do for fun these days,Depression

This is just my experience I do not know whether anybody else is the same I find that the things that would give me a jolt of hope a spark are not the grand or important things but rather trivial ones mostly connected with my interest it is not the thought of giving away my daughter when she married some one that kept me going but the thought that I really wanted to see how MCU phase 4 pans outit is not the thought of seeing my kids graduate or do something with their lives but the thought that I might see my team the Phoenix Suns winning the championship in a few daysSometimes I felt guilty because it seems like movies and sports are more important than family but it is just how it is with me And I will take anything I can get to stay the course The things with the family become the end result not the motivation The things that keeps you going,Depression

As a child I always told myself and people that I would be a French teacher Not a dream job per se but one supposedly reachable rightAt the beginning of high school I decided to learn Swedish and fell completely in love with the language the culture the country as a whole My goal to be a regular French teacher evolved and now I would absolutely love to become a French teacher in SwedenBut it feels doomed to failure and it is seriously eating me upWhy Well I stutter and have other speech issues My stutter is not that terrible unless I am in a stressinducing situation there it can get pretty bad Even worse I tend to dissociate I do not think this is the right word after a bad stutter This is a terrible thing to happen as a teacher rightI am also anxious have very low selfesteem and my social batteries run low most the time What if it is too much work for my apathetic ass What if I am not good enough What if students do not like me What if they make fun of my appearance Of my stutterMy anxiety sadly comes with scopophobia I was never able in school to stand up and go to the blackboard I was never able to speak in front of other people At the end of my second high school year I had to give a presentation with a girl of my class in front of three unknown teachers I broke down The girl and I thank her wholeheartedly for her kindess and attempt at comfort had to hug me to calm me down first time I was hugged or even touched ever since I was ten when my pet bird died so this hug really meant a lot to me Being looked at or just being noticeable at best makes me uncomfortable at worst makes me freak outHow am I supposed to be working as a teacher in those conditions Am I fucking delusional to consider getting this jobActually I thought about working all alone in nature something like that Sadly my academic profile is literatureoriented so I have a hard time finding a formation open to profiles like mine Places are limited and usually very far from where I live Either way I am physically not in shape and have a particularly bad spine the wonderful aftermath of a fractured vertebra that had to heal on its own yet most jobs about nature require to be in pretty good shapeI have seen young adults usually friends buy a farm and work together It would be amazing for me to have this opportunity But I know no one I have no training in farm jobs and then again I am physically in not so great shapeThis autumn will be my third attempt at completing the first year of Northern studies I have been trying to complete it ever since 2018 and in 20202021 I did nothing of my life I feel horrible How am I supposed to get by in life as an adult if I cannot even complete a University year in a study field that I adoreI am such an inconvenience and a disappointment I feel so sorry for my parents My life seems doomed to failureMy apologies for the long rant My life is doomed to failure,Suicidal

I am so tired and exhausted every single day I am 21 F living with my toxic family My father died when I was 18 But I was not close to him We barely had a relationship He never really cared about kids My earliest memory of my childhood is of him getting angry about some random thing and throwing away the food on the table and then hitting my mother I have seen my mother get beaten up ever since I was a kid She would hit him back while trying to defend herself They would threaten to kill each other during fights Kid me would try desperately to loosen my fathers fists clenching my mothers hair But I was just a small kid with no physical strength so I could not do much except beg and cry for them to stop hurting each other This was long agoOne day my grandmother fathers side died and I guess something triggered within my dad even tho he was not close to her AT ALL and he lost his shit He started behaving erratically Few weeks later we find out through an office colleague of his that my father had been fired from his work We had no idea He used to go to work everyday in the morning Turns out he was just pretending Through this said colleague we got to know more he had angry outburst at work spouting weird stuff After some more strange incidents not going into details we got an appointment with a psychiatrist and my dad was later diagnosed with schizophrenia This was when the domestic abuse hit its peak He became way more violent I remember one day he broke my mother nose and she started bleeding Fast forward to 23 years I have no sense of time really it all seems like a blur now he stopped taking his meds became super submissive barely said anything I realised eventually that he was depressed exhibited all the signs Things changed Now my mother became the abuser She would tell him to die how useless he was what a burden he was on us 247 She also started hitting him I tried to stop My father did not He would just sit there and let her do it I have an elder brother too but he had gone for college so I was the only one who had to witness all of this all alone with no help This lasted for some time until he actually listened to her He killed himself around a week after my 18th birthday My mother found his body in the middle of the nightI am glad he is dead At least he does not have to suffer anymore I do not knowBut now years after all of this shit things somehow seem to have worsened if that is even possible I used it believe that once my father was gone from the picture things would be better We could lead a peaceful life Oh boy was I wrong My mothers toxicity oozed out I think I have become the replacement of my father Everyday it is the same thing I am a useless worthless piece of shit A waste of space How she regrets giving birth to me How I am a crazy person who need help and more Manipulation gaslighting mental emotional physical abuse you name it she got it I have and still am faced it all I try my best to do all the chores and not make her angry but it never matters She will find something to mock taunt and insult me I have no place or privacy to cry it is shitI have kept alllll this shit inside of me without a single soul knowing until recently I told me best friend Well not everything but I gave a general overview But I keep stopping myself from saying anything about the present times because it is all so intense and I do not think she would be able to handle all this Even I cannot Everyday is the same I am so fucking exhausted and tired of everything I wish I could kill myself but I have wayy too much hope to do it I truly want to live a happier healthier life because I deserve it I deserve love and care But my god this is difficult 21 years of trauma and I do not see an end to it I wish I would cease to exist Why is killing yourself so hard I am dead inside I need help but there is nothing I have no motivation to do anything No purpose in life Sometimes I think I might be depressed but then again I am able to get up do my chores I do not know I have also started seeing signs of trauma during arguments and confrontations and it scares me Nothing seems to be go right in my life Everything is a fucked up mess When will this end P S If you are still reading this fucked up tragedy of a life story what is wrong with you Lol Thank you for reading I swear the Universe has a vendetta against me,Suicidal

truly seriously disastrously failing Anyways full storyDiagnosed with adhd at 8 medicated at 10 Started on ritalin Changed to concerta at some point Switched to vyvance which made me suicidal No one noticed and i did not realize it was medication related so i was on that for two years Went back to concerta Last change to medication was in about 2014 Struggled academically my whole life Even with the diagnosis I was convinced I was just too lazy to do well I believe I am smart but academia and I never agreed Got a degree in web development and graphic design I honest to god love it I love doing what I do but even that is not enough I do not even draw for fun anymore All i do is listen to the same podcasts over and over again Anways Since then finally took ahold of my mental health got some proper diagnoses in order to start treatment Potentially relevant diagnoses avoidant and ruminative type OCD anxiety and depression which is the newest discovery also should have been the first It was a no shit sherlock kind of moment so treatment is just beginning through therapy and wellbutrin The Obsessive Compulsions create a need for absolute perfection The OCD says something bad will happen if everything is not perfect And the anxiety says but you could never anticipate every way to make something perfect and what if its already flawed before you even start The depression says not like you could ever achieve perfect anyways so why even bother The ADHD says lol by the way here is a red herring to follow this will certainly make your work perfect if you spend 12 hours researching it oh and by the way here is zero serotonin for any of the work you need to do but hey you can have a days worth of serotonin if you keep scrolling on reddit Also let us forget to do laundry for 6

Will I be depressed forever Ever since I 21F was younger i struggled with emotions Id cry whenever frustrated or angry and still do to this day My parents would often say I was a drama queen for this reason Kids would also talk about me being overly sensitive and crying too much But i was genuinely hurt Nowadays whenever Im sad or cry those memories get in my head and i convince myself that Im faking it like my feelings arent genuine like i am doing it for attention even if I am genuinely hurt I feel like I cant trust myself I struggle with OCD depression and anxiety Im taking Buspar for anxiety ashwaganda and did some OCD therapy for about 23 months weekly The OCD aspect somewhat improved However my depression has skyrocketed Ive always been able to make friends easily however it wasnt because of my personality but the way I can match others energy I Can get every guy to like me not because they like me but because Im easy to talk to I feel like I dont even have an identity a personality I dont feel like a person and therefore dont feel deserving of love or anything I struggle with being insecure sometimes as well In eighth grade these boys who i thought were friends of mine came behind my chair and repeatedly called me ugly until I cried That moment haunts me forever Another moment i love my mom to pieces but something she said killed me I was a rotten girl growing up Again i was mad at the world I felt no one understood me I had a strict dad who is emotionally unavailable and a helicopter mom not like this anymore we are best friends now They again would always make incidents my fault for being too sensitive One time I went too far with being a rotten preteen and my mom said you know I used to always dream of having a daughter and now that I have you this is not what I wanted Along those lines Heartbreaking to hear All of these experiences have made me feel like no one Like Im empty Like no one really cares for me My family doesnt even care to talk about what I learned at university the place where I spend 30 hours a week at I feel somewhat invisible I feel empty but so full of sadness I lack empathy and feel awkward when others express their emotions I want to be happier and feel joy and excitement and empathy and i just cant I feel broken I have friends and supportive family they know I struggle but they dont know how bad I cant afford to break down everyday I feel traumatized by life and feel unmotivated to keep moving forward I wont do anything to end it Im expressing its really really hard for me right now I just want to know Is this forever Side note only hobby I have time for is exercise atm,Depression

Hi folks For about 7 years now I have felt general depression like symptoms that may or may not be associated with depression 1 low self esteem 2 general FOMO and always feeling like I am receiving the short end of experiences or no experiences at all 3 resentment without because towards successful people or for acquaintances that I interact with attractive people in particular 4 getting upset and impatient when I am not where I want to be in life5 more introverted behaviour than I probably would be otherwise displaying 6 General anxiety when engaging socially with others 7 resort to escapism when upset8 when at social events get upset and think about the past about the lack of social experiences and how unfair life is There were times it was not always like this that is what makes me skeptical about my own diagnoses Some of the things I described above have been on and off Although as of late I have felt all of that Your thoughts would be very much appreciated Should I get a diagnoses I suspect my own life circumstances contribute to these feelings that is why I am unsure whether to get a diagnoses or just fix my own life Not sure if I am depressed,Depression

Am 26 and still have not finished college I got into the recent stock market craze and lost 100000 in liquid assets last March started with 14k life savings cash that I saved up in January that ballooned over a couple of months since then I mentally spiraled downwards and my grades suffered ended up getting academically suspended from college It felt like I finally had a chance beyond a life of suffering wage slaving being stuck in a low socio economic swamp I cannot even afford going to college anymore Since March got help that is therapy and a psychiatrist which neither I feel so far has really helped in any significant fashion I actually have since sessions and being prescribed medication sunk even worse into a black pit of despair I do not think people understand even the basic surface level of mental health solutions in modern day Just seeing a therapist and taking meds will not fix everyone The state of how at least in America mental health treatment is addressed is frankly a joke It was easier for me to get prescribed antidepressants than ordering a pizza I flat out told my therapist that I thought my psychiatrist is a fucking clown 15 minute session where you briefly describe your symptoms almost like a WebMD referral robot but it is an actual licensed professional and they just throw pills at you at the end of the expensive session voila come back for an in progress consultation if you need to more dosage or to hop to a different med that probably will have another slew of side effects Talk to anyone that is actively or have been in therapy and ask them how many therapists they been to before they found the right one Why is there such a core difference with these professionals Because it is honestly a goddamn circus internally and I assume there is no standardized method of licensed schooling apparently Go exercise Take a hot shower Have a routine I do all of those things but I am just a high functioning depressed person that can clean do chores without my living conditions being something from rneckbeardnests What am I doing now Soon moving back home now to my backwards rural country hometown with no hope for the near or long term future I just been trying to distract myself reading books or playing video games listening to vinyl records Honestly and truly I think I am going to end it all early August There is not a single thing feeling goal in this universe that I desire anymore Last night had a nightmare that brought up past mistakes even in my dreams I feel guilty and suffer When I wake up I just feel like a walking zombie and the anhedonia saps every morsel from anything that I try to do Resignation from Life,Suicidal

Not really suicidal per se but I have always had one thought from the past that has effected me even up until this point I used to work at a grocery store called Publix and was a produce clerk for a while Anyways this memory from the past consists of my assistant manager being frustrated with me because I did not get enough product out in a set amount of time I remember his face getting red and yelling at me on the floor in front of customers telling me to go home because I was not of any help This was the type of manager to order so much product and make his workers pack so much shit it was disgusting He used to hide products behind the shelves just so that it would get out and make him not look bad Idk why this specific memory just makes me feel like shit but it is a time where I tried my hardest to do something and I was belittled so much by this jackass that his red infuriated face is still stuck in my memory Depression,Suicidal

Convinced I have MS Hey I cant seem to calm myself down right now Ive completely convinced myself I have MS my HA has been seriously terrible lately I keep having panic attacks and I have embarrassingly broken down several times this past week at work This post is long Im very sorry Im a 21 yo female Ive had health anxiety for nearly all my life For the past few months Ive had pain through my left buttock and leg Went to Dr who said it was pinched sciatic nerve which completely makes sense my dad has also had the same problem and it sounds exactly like what I have anyway I still obsessed over it being a blood clot or something serious Sometimes when I am very stressed my arms tend to go weak and I shake I also will feel numb in certain areas of my body Recently though the area around the left side of my mouth has felt weaknumb when Im anxious I always check in the mirror and its not drooping or anything It makes my anxiety go through the roof I also am very aware of my speaking when this happens and I sometimes feel as if I slur my words It never lasts very long and usually if I take anxiety medication it goes away fairly quick However when googling this I know I cant keep googling things like the first result is MS I cant shake it Here are my other symptoms very tired I did just start on two anxiety medications so Im trying to attribute my tiredness to that Im constantly tense My jaw is nearly always tight and my shoulders are always up to my ears tight chestfeels like Im short of breath frequently I think Im like slightly hyperventilating at all times frequent nausea blurry vision especially at night or after looking at my phone for a long time having it now unfortunately feeling disconnected dizzy when Im extremely anxious i get very itchy on my thighs and on my arms This has happened all my life Usually if Im wearing warm clothes under a blanket or Ive just taken a hot shower Ive always had this and assumed dry skin but I learned that sometimes MS can cause hot itchiness that is often mirrored on the body even worse I noticed yesterday that in the places Ive scratched really hard Ive even left small bruises and a few scratches for as long as I can remember Ive had this thing where if Im laughing really hard I lose my grip cant hold a pencil or something idk its weird when Im anxious sometimes when Im not my hands shake ive always been pretty strong but for as long as I can remember my arms shake like if Im pouring a pitcher of water or something i have also had excema on my hands for the last few years Dr said due to stress and excessive hand washing which lines up but it did start out mirrored I watched a video yesterday of a man who had been hardcore dealing with MS fears who went to the doctor and he was fine and all He listed a few of his symptoms a lot of which I shared He also mentioned very weak muscles and twitching along with pins and needles in his limbs I was thankful I hadnt really had any of that But seriously just a few hours later all these symptoms hit Even worse today My hands have been jittery the whole time Ive typed this I know there are more symptoms Im sorry this post is a mess Im seriously so scared Lately all I can think about is my health Im finding it hard to do basic tasks and function normally Im sorry that this was so long I just wondered if anyone else deals with this,Anxiety/Stress
I know there are people I care about who would miss me if I died who would blame themselves for the rest of their lives but it is so hard to careSo hard to care when I think about how when I am dead I will not have to witness it It will be impossible for me to care when I am dead This is heightened even more because I do not believe in an afterlife To me when I die the world simply will not exist anymore because I will not be around to witness itEven if I have things to look forward to in this life things that excite me it is still so hard to care So hard to care when I know none of this will matter anymore to me if I died I live at a parents house and I have no possible means of killing myself right now I do not imagine I will until I am an adult and completely on my own But I do not want to grow up at the same timeI am only a she will of the person I used to be without my art it feels like I am nothing anymore but I cannot drawI hate seeing I cannot even get the motivation to watch tvI cannot get over any of my habits unless it is forced upon me No matter how hard I try I always go backI think I am better than most people on this world but I still do not feel good enough I hate this world and all of the sick people in it And there is no hope of change in my lifetime I hate my parents,Suicidal

Anxiety and Weed Hi looking for a bit of advice and experiences from ranxiety here Around Christmas I started to develop some kind of anxiety disorder and had a lot of panic attacks For most of my life Ive always been a little anxious and tended to overthink but these symptoms were just much worse Up to this point Ive also been smoking weed but not excessively mostly once a week After developing said disorder weed now increases my symptoms despite it never doing something like this before and it mostly calming me down Even when I had a greenout I mainly suffered physical symptoms In response to my symptoms I started with autogenic training a lot of introspection about my fears and stopped smoking for about a month With this I got the worst of it under control Since then Ive been smoking a few times with mixed results sometimes I get more anxious and panicky but on other occasions it also felt like a normal high Right now I still have some lingering symptoms that can be better or worse depending on the day so Ill definitely quit weed until I can resolve this My question now is if any of you here have suffered something similar and were you eventually able to smoke without getting anxious again Ill be honest I quit enjoyed being high so that would be quite the bummer but certainly not the end of the world Thanks in advance,Anxiety/Stress

I have been depressed for about 56 years now and increasingly suicidal over the past year or so I went to the hospital once a few months ago but I do not think I expressed my problem well enough and just ended up getting sent home right away It essentially accomplished nothing if anything it made things worse It made me feel like they did not care enough to help or that I would need to attempt suicide for it to be taken more seriously Now its a few months later and I am becoming very suicidal The feeling just keeps growing and growing I keep staring at bottles of pills waiting to build up the courage to just do it even though I really do not want to do it Mainly due to the fact nothing feels like it will be able to help me at this point I feel permanently and irreversibly damaged But for my mom I need to give it one last shot What I really want to know is from the people who have been in either inpatient or outpatient programs what is the overall experience like What should I expect What is done to try and repair my mental health Any details on the specific types of therapy and strategies that they use would be appreciated I am an extremely nervous and anxious person I would love to learn more about what I would be getting into it might make it a little easier for me to give it a shotThank you what is it like getting help at the hospital What should I expect,Depression

I do not really know what to say I have bipolar disorder and depression like a lot of other people I have tried to kill myself on 2 different occasions both a year apart it is been a year since the last attempt Tomorrow I am planning to run away from home I want to go to a store purchase some ropes and possibly hang myself in the mountains that are near the house I am staying at I do not care what happens after I die my family are a bunch of assholes and I feel like my friends only reactions would be that motherfuker finally killed himself I personally hate my family they cannot see that they are the root of the problem They are the reason I am an atheist they are the reason I hate woman and that I am bisexual they are the reason for my depression The worst of it all they blame it on other people for example my best friend I just tired of their shit I am tired of this shitty life They put pressure on me to excel in school and they do not realize I cannot handle it I am 18 and I have heard so many people say that it is not worth killing yourself that life has so much to offer and that kind of bullshit My family keeps reminding me that I have it easy right now and that the adult life is a lot worse I know that it is going to be tougher being an adult but I cannot handle how life is now how can I handle it when I am an adult If I follow through with the running away and buying the rope I will post again I am tired,Suicidal

Hi all I think I might be on the verge of Suicide I feel like I have run out of options I do not live in a country that has free medical care I cancelled my private insurance and public hospitals are the most frightening thing ever here I live in a 3rd world country where if you go to a public facility you get abusedmistreated etcI started taking antidepressants a few years ago for anxiety as it is what my partner wanted me to do as they were a Doctor and I had bad anxiety since a kid We broke up but I found it hard stop taking the meds as when I did I got terrible withdrawals But eventually the side effects got so bad I went to a Psychiatrist and tried various antidepressants but I just got worse and worse that I decided to quit taking them and that was last September The withdrawals were crazy and I felt super depressed after stopping them even though I tapered A few months ago as I was still struggling so I booked myself into a rehabsuper expensive that dealt with coming off psychiatric medication Worst idea ever It was in the middle of nowhere and I was put with hardcore drug addicts and I cldnt just leave plus it was semicultish It was the scariest experience ever and now since leaving I still have the problems with withdrawal plus now I am traumatized and I have terrible sensations in my body as a result Totally screwed up I knw Anyway I cannot do this anymore I have tried reaching out to family but they are not really the helping type I have pretty much been on my own since kid ie having to be my own parent and I am surprised I have even made it this farI have written my goodbye note Bought some gear I have decided I am going to hike to the middle of nowhere and just die Unfortunately my country has no social security and I feel so shitty I cannot possibly hold down a job Plus in my country If you get a basic job like working at McDonalds you are pretty much living in a shack in dire poverty as it pays way to little to survive I have some savings but I have decided that there is little it can do for me I have lost my will to carry on fighting In any case I realised that with it I can actually make a difference in other peoples lives instead on wasting it on mine there is enough to build a house for a friend in Nepal enough to send a girl in rural India to school and look after all her needs until she graduates and enough to donate to a religious organization to do something substantial I feel if I spend any more of it on me I am taking away from what it cld give someone else I am also just tired and do not feel like I can get better I feel completely alone and isolated I used to be very social but lately I have withdrawn I really think this is it My biggest fear is becoming a ghost I have been praying alot but I feel hopeless I think I have got another day or two left in me I tried to withdrawal all my money today so I cld donate it but I was told I have got a 24hr lock on my savings so I have to wait for that I just pray that in my next life things are better I have tried to live a good life I really have and always tried to live morallySo I am open to suggestions This feels like it though I would previously thought of suicide but never come this far before as to plan everything and decide where my moneys going and how I will die etc I have also left my apartment and am staying in a hotel close to the mountains and cut myself off from the worldThanks for reading I think this is it,Suicidal

Final doctor appointment tomorrow tired of constantly seeking reassurance Ive decided that Im having my final doctor appointment tomorrow this is something that has been a huge battle for me but over the last weeks I have decided that this is the only way I can and will make it out of this anxiety Here is the deal I have been experiencing multiple symptoms as mentioned before in other posts the symptoms have varied from Brain fog dizzyness blurred vision sore throat swollen tonsils coating on my tongue yellow and white very reduced energy fatigue and headaches The thing is that my sore throat and coating on my tongue wont go away and my doctor said to come back if it didnt fade over time the other symptoms tend to come and go so Ive kinda figured out that these are my main anxiety symptoms which is good because then I know when im getting anxious and stressed out Ive been a very heavy caffeine user over the past 23 years and ive tried to minimalize the usage of it as I figured out that i basicly needed caffeine to function at times Today i used a bigger dosage of caffeine and it really got me feeling off so I guess i will be dropping it off completely atleast for now when im feeling anxious and stressed out about my health situation Even though I feel somewhat weak and off Ive learned a lot from this fear of health problems and I personally think that it had made me a more strong and better person Tomorrow I will have my final chat with my doctor and I am ready to accept his word for the truth hopefully this will take my mind to other places Its wierd how something as minor as a sore throat lasting for a long time can make you feel so sure its something serious,Anxiety/Stress

I was diagnosed with it early in life but I have always dealt with it Just as I have gotten a bit older it seems to have become a more constant more permanent fixture to my existenceIn the past you could maybe attribute it to this or that like bad luck or even substance abuse Or even the loss of friends andor family or other traumatic events but I am yearspast such events and I have better habits now Plus out of sheer necessity I kind of remobilized myself and even got an excellent job again at the start of the year Something I am good at that I can do well So I cannot really work on those aspects anymore I am legit in all that again it is like I made it somewhere but it changed nothing internallyBut things I do none of it changes my utter lack of feeling My total disinterest in life No matter the changes I make things that would be considered and are positive do nothing to elevate my mood and general outlook on life Whether I am in elite physical condition again or not or earning good money or not none of it really helps It feels really nice to be able to buy something for someone I care about but every time I get paid it almost all just goes to my savings Like I just have no real motivation or ambition it is like a burnout or something like just being so worn out from carrying great responsibility at times for so longI honestly cannot think of much to buy that I really want One of the last holdouts was videogames I have always enjoyed them but lately I do not really even feel motivated to do gaming of my own Then the other day a really sweet coworker of mine gave me a really nice compliment but I just kind of smiled and felt kind of sad about it for some reason Like I felt like it was wasted on me and that she would be better off devoting that energy to someone elseAnd yeah I do have unhealthy selfdestructive thoughts that at times seem comforting I try not to indulge them it is all fairly dysfunctional at times I disappoint myself hereIt sucks too because I cannot give up There is not one person on this Earth to whom I can run for support everyone is gone moved on or I just blew it with them and they do not want anything to do with me So if I do not earn a check I have nothing I must continue and it is all just bleak at times since I would really wish just to go somewhere far away somewhere dark and isolated Like a sanctuary for despair which I hate to sayit is just a reality of my life and it kind of sucks that I have not been able to move past it much despite accomplishing some great things recently Rather it seems more a part of me more certainly than before Anyway sorry for the wall of text Just I would been carrying these thoughts for sometime now Seems Like I will Never Be Rid of Depression,Depression

HelloSometimes i feel like i am having moments of total clarity where i perceive the world as clear and true as possible physically but also mentally It feels almost like you would feel during meditation However in these moments all that i seem to find is emptiness and futility it is almost like something i carry around with me all time subconciously it is the realization that we as humans live our lifes based on beliefs and values that ironically have zero value it is all constructed in our heads and we clinge to these things almost in panic to not fall into this pit of emptinessI feel like i have this realization since my early teens and still have not found any satisfying answers to it How am i supposed to live life in this society realizing that almost all the values that define me as the person i am now are basically meaningless that i have been chasing illusions of a fulfillment that basically only means slavery If i was born a nihilist i would just start living life recklessly and hedonistic But i feel like i am far too sensitive to just throw away everything i believed inI do not even know why i am typing this here maybe because there is still this thing called hope in me Hope that there is someone who can relate kind of ironic that there is still hope within me since hope is basically the one thing that makes us humans strive for things that are not real How to deal with nihilism,Depression

can you be deeply in love with 2 people at the same time So theres this guy An ex ss officer He fell in love with a jewish prisoner in Auschwitz and had a relationship with her After the war he tried to contact her to be with him but she wanted nothing more to do with him so he started a new life family got married He had this one picture ofherin her auschwitz prisoner uniform and he used to cut out her head and put her on another clothing away from Auschwitz He used to do this for the most of his life the filmaker says it was a way for him to imagine an alternative life they could have hadHe copied the picture and kept it in his wallet until the day he died So when his daughter was 16 she said her father told her about this Jewish girl and that he never ever in his life felt true love like that He even gave his daughter a locket with a picture of him and his ex Jewish girlfriend not her mother His daughter said it was odd and she also said that this Jewish girl was the love of his lifein a documentary there was a documentary made about them So the filmmaker which is close to both his and Jewish girls families said that the ss officer was deeply and truly in love in this Jewish girl till the day he died His wife also knew about his exSo in 1972 he had to go to the court because of his war crimes against humanity and his ex Jewish girlfriend was a witnesswhen he saw her after 30 years of no contact he started to cry Does that mean even while married to his wife he loved his ex girlfriend more Does that mean that he would maybe leave his wife for her,Anxiety/Stress

illness that isnt getting better My face is swollen and so is my body my wounds wont heal I cant exercise and feel fatigued every day my veins bulge and I have extremely pale skin my eyes are also bulgingmy brother pointed this out to me and I thought I was the only one who thought this my teeth are cracking and my gums are pale numbness in every single part of my body blood pools anhedonia and dissociation impaired memory and I cant even count or decide what to eat have to double check my spelling and memory and even then I forget bathroom struggles insomnia weak bones head feels full and swollen fingernails have started to club believe it or not hair and nails dont grow blue extremities and struggling to breathe cant hold head up and body feels very heavy to carry sharp pains around my body aching pains blurred vision and double vision i cant even walk anymore and my ligaments crack all the time pre 2017 this would not have been the case because i injured myself very severly and do not realise the damage i have done doctors are saying nothings wrong with me but thats not true the problems have built up over time which i suspect is a problem with my vascular system but getting seen in the UK is very hard i have also bought a healthcare plan which is not private health insurance but all that i can afford11 monthly The extent of damage it has done to me made me realize that i may not ever be normal again IF i ever get treated that is and so i feel like my only option is to die I know some people say that people who are crippled and have disabilities can have long satisfying lives but that is not the life for me especially considering there was nothing wrong with me before i always dream to be that way again but i know i wont get that anymore and i wont be happy at all the damage it has done to me probably affected my brain to the point where i dont think it will ever recover or my heart or my bones or my optic nerves so i dont think its worth living if I have longlasting complications And also the cause was selfharm I know it sounds silly but it could have been prevented I was mentally ill and the things I did werent normal looking back at it now and its all my parents fault they convoluted my idea of normal since I was a little kid I never got the help i needed not even for my selective mutism and now Im screwed for good Im no good anymore and worthless I cant even make or remember memories and this isnt the depression speaking since I had an urge to fix my life and get back on track Now I have a wound that will never heal My parents were extremely toxic and detrimental since my youth my only fantasies were ones of running away I dont have much contact with them and am stuck in the house with them In 2017 I selfharmed so bad my left side went number and weaker and I have been that way ever since Now its caused so many problems because of something pressing on my vascular system causing harm to my entire body but I am told there is nothing wrong with me even by the most toxic people of all my parents they got so sick of me trying to reach out for help my father shouted at me and sent me into a burst of tears I choked on my tea but I persisted and called the doctor and asked for an appointment he took me to the docs but I feel like Im in a losing game I dont really have any positive options anymore and am in so much pain 247 Ive lost my sight somewhat hearing function mobility emotions and cognition and am basically becoming a vegetable Even if I do get treated it will be too late as the damage has left permanent wounds Ive shown someone pics before and they have admitted its pretty messed up what I have been through I am struggling for answers but at the least I can get a diagnosis just so I can shove it in peoples faces and prove them wrong But other than that I just dont know what to do with my life anymore I got tired from making this post I took a few breaks and am still lethargic My doctor that i recently visited also noticed that i was looking a bit pale so for me thats been a relief he was quite attentive and offered to give me a blood test which is next month so i have to struggle to next month He weighed meim 48kg now and we talked about my symptoms and I did mention to him it has to do with my vascular system its now a test of time to see what will happen Realistically I dont think my prognosis is too good But people are becoming more attentive to how messed up my body is so I think thats a good but far too little too late now,Depression

I am frustrated that is the constant theme with my life I just turned 30 last month and never really even wanted to make it that far in this state of mediocrity My stepdad broke me as a person growing up I am frankly terrified of men especially loud obnoxious southern men like him who seem to all spout out endless streams of racist hate and blind adherence to tradition he is the exact definition of the type of person I hate most and I see him in seemingly every man I have to interact with And as a man I am expected to be the same And I am terrified of standing up to them all so I just stay quiet I am just as much to blame as they are for so much that is wrong in the world because I am so chickenshit I cannot call them out when they are wrongI spent between the ages of 1723 absorbed in a religious phase that wasted away any potential I had I developed a passivity that still lingers to this day although in a more secular form I hated my life then and did not want to admit it out of some sense of guilt so I just focused every aspect of my life around anticipating death in hopes of finally getting to reach some illusionary paradise in an afterlife I did not care about anything I just wanted some job I could tolerate to get myself through life until I could finally die I thought too much and read too much to put it simply and started to question how the world worked I began to take seriously the possibility that my religion was incorrect and that there might not actually be any meaning any purpose other than what I defined for myself I became obsessed with trying to correct my lifes trajectory having wasted away the years I should have been using to achieve education in favor of Christian superstition I had filled my head with I wanted to be brilliant more than anything I wanted to try to make up for what I had lost I tried like hell to get myself straightened out and through school but failed horribly at it I took on a few jobs trying to pay my way through school and hated every second of them surrounded constantly by the kind of person my stepdad was The kind of person I am apparently supposed to be in order to be a good godfearing American I spent another year trying to cling desperately to something I could live for I got myself out of my moms house at least so that I was finally away from her own brand of religious nonsense I successfully got into an actual relationship for the first time in my life and basically just coasted through the next few years I obviously could not go to school since I had fucked that up So I just did menial work I hated and coped with life as best as I could I could not help myself and started seriously studying on my own a couple years ago right around the beginning of 2018 With no direction or guidance I basically just gravitated wildly toward any philosophical topic I could find that interested me and began to seriously write in an attempt at parsing my own view of reality and my place in it as well as where to go from there This project continued along with my regular visits to therapy and medication that I genuinely believed helped me at the time My counselor began to suggest I look into trying to return to school again It was something I was afraid of but I did start to research it and found that it was possible for me to do it I went back to school in fall 2019 and loved it I certainly did not feel any connection to any fellow students but it gave me regular intellectual challenges and a sense of growth I was not able to take as many classes in person as I would have liked to because of work but I tried to make the most of the experience 2020 everything went to shit for everyone it seemed and I was no exception I had started to develop psoriatic arthritis over the past year and this escalated to a point where I lost most of my grip strength and could barely function physically at all Given that the only things I am qualified to do for pay involve mindlessly moving things around or doing repetitive physical tasks I felt broken and useless at doing something I hated but had to do no matter what if I wanted to survive I began to consider suicide for the first time in years and wound up hospitalized I eventually lost my job in the summer and struggled until I could get some treatment for PsA When I started infusions I felt immediate relief and regained some sense of utility as a person I was struggling with balancing classes with the job I was able to get and I jumped around aimlessly between a few jobs I lost the last job I had in January I was working at a food bankthrift store donation center and missed work so I could attend a job interview elsewhere It was not that I hated the job I simply hated being there and having to work for a literal church I hated sitting in employee meetings and hearing everyone ramble about how all the problems were caused by satan and that we needed to remain strong against the enemy knowing full well that they meant people like me Useless godless leftist scum who just get in the way I never got the job I interviewed for and I have been jobless ever since I lived off savings and unemployment through that time I lost my patience with school because as always I fail at every endeavor it seems I felt out of place trying desperately to claw my way into an academic setting I had no business being in as someone from a working class background I have no patience for formalities for gatekeeping or for endless bureaucracy I cannot fathom suffering through another 6 years of this to hopefully stand a chance at being valued as someone worth taking seriously when I know statistically that is incredibly unlikely I do not have contacts I do not know anyone I have no shortcuts I can take I haphazardly withdrew from college in early April citing frustration with my lack of belonging in a field which is more interested in maintaining extant social institutions than upending them As someone who actively hates society as it is I have lost nearly all interest in attempting to stabilize it as though we need only vote for the right liberal every four years to make everything better while nothing materially changes and the rest of the world suffers for it I phrases my withdrawal in a way which understandably appeared to indicate a threat to myself and campus police came and made me go to the ER Another hospital stay I have stopped talking to my girlfriend about this stuff She does not really care or seem to understand anymore and has told me as much at times She is comfortable with her place in the world where she can rely on the police to handle her problems for her and get rid of those pesky undesirables who make too much noise at night rather than going and having a discussion with them herself And I am no better They do not bother me like they seem to bother her but I cannot shake the fear that the situation will escalate out of controlAnyway I still have no job and I have no desire to return to college having once again wasted more years of my life I am tired of going outside every goddamn day and being hounded by people trying to give me religious pamphlets and by my family telling my to pray and everything will get better I just want someone to take me fucking seriously for once in my life when I beg them to stop shoving religious shit in my face And I am too fucking cowardly to outright tell them I am an atheist They cannot even comprehend how such a thing could be possible It is as though Christianity is some truth embedded in nature itself I am terrified of finding work again because my work history is terrible and I have become obsessed with the desire to live authentically which seems impossible to reconcile with the daily process of work I am an inconvenience on society which would rather like to just go about their lives praying and patiently waiting for an afterlife they will never get and insisting that I and others do the same going so far as to legislate their preferred world into existence I just want to get out of everyone is way and be left alone I am tired of hating their ignorant fucking superstitions to the point where it is exhausting and I just want to die so I can stop bothering them I am terrified of dying because the only thing I really care about anymore are my two cats And I do not think my girlfriend would be able to keep them since her family is allergic and I cannot stand the thought of them suffering but I cannot stand the thought of suffering myself I am a bitter asshole and I just want to see the world look like it might someday be a tolerable place to live in but we are just going to cook ourselves to death slowly while making a quick buck along the way I cannot write for shit anymore My mind is everywhere I do not know how the fuck I can work like this and I do not even want to at all I do not do anything but sit around playing video games these days because they give me some semblance of control over something I run a DampD campaign every week And I have my cats These are small things but they are all I have anymore I do not think humanity is ever going to unfuck itself and I do not want to sit around watching it get worse But I simultaneously do not want to let go of these brief tiny pleasures I am trying to figure out a way to just stay out of everyone is way so I can at least live out my cats lives In a sense I am back where I was before Just waiting to die Wanting to just get by long enough to finally be rid of it I hate this Just want to get out of everyone is way,Depression

I have had mobility issues since I was twenty three following a difficult pregnancy that triggered inflammatory arthritis and fibromyalgiachronic fatigue syndrome Over the years Ive had a few falls due to being very unsteady on my feet at the best of times which have added to my mobility issues My right ankle and calf are permanently injured I have achilles tendonitis plantar faciitis and the muscle in my calf has tightened so much due to the shortening of my tendons that my foot points instead of sitting normally I have osteoarthritis in my right hip which slips in the socket and causes a lot of pain and this has all had an ongoing impact on the rest of my body as my back often spasms or locks and I have issues with a frozen shoulder that limits the use of my right arm On top of all of this I have kidney liver and bladder problems,Anxiety/Stress

Going to Battle HA Hi All First time posting here So grateful to have found this community I have struggled with HA for the last 10 years with each year worse than the one before For the last 6 months my HA has been with leukemia Usually my anxiety with any illness is from a few days to a few weeks but never on the order of months Enough is enough I no longer want to live in fear of any random bruise I am thin and bruise like a peach or to have my husband constantly reassure me that I dont have cancer and engage in my safety behaviors A relative of mine is actually a clinical psychologist who deals with anxiety disorders She referred me to a wellrespected clinic that is able to work with my insurance and they want to schedule me for the intake The problem Im scared to actually take the next step and start therapy Ive avoided dealing with my triggers and upbringing that promoted me becoming this way The clinic specializes in exposure therapy for anxiety disorders and I am so scared thinking about putting myself in even controlled situations that will manufacture my anxiety Has anyone successfully done therapy and conquered the HA monster I just need to pickup the phone and make the call Would love to make progress on this in 2018 Help,Anxiety/Stress

Can someone relate or am I broken I need to premise this with saying that I recognise that I drink as it is the only time I dont feel anxious anymore and its a vicious cycle And so please telling me that stopping drinking is an obvious step I am taking now and it certainly doesnt help to say this to me now Recently I have been feeling increasingly anxious and paranoid after drinking about things I may have done or said during the night This is obviously even worse if there are moments of the night I dont remember or if I blackout After a recent night out I dont remember going back home from the club with some colleagues who I am semi close with im new to the job There is basically a 200meter walk home that I dont remember I asked and I was told by them that I was very drunk and was vomiting but other than that it was a great night and we should do it again However I am absolutely convinced that I said or did something bad that night Just like Im always convinced I did something bad the previous time That I maybe told them I want to rapehurtabuse someone or that I was racist towards someone or that I said a secret And even if they said that it was absolutely fine Im convinced that they are hiding something from me that they are waiting for the perfect moment to expose me That they are all laughingtalking behind my back I feel like I ruminate over scenarios I may not remember or know even happen so much that memories almost build themselves in my head and from moment to moment a memory is more and more vivid This is not a new thing in my life I wake up terrified of checking my phone for embarrassing or illegal things I may have done if theres a murder in the news I check the location to ensure there was no chance it could be me The same happens in my sober life I convince myself that someone is angry at me so I will spend literal hours looking over a phone chat between us Thoughts or worries plant themselves in my head and I cannot let them go One day I raped someone the next I have cancer One day I pissed someone off the next day the past is coming to get me Im terrified of getting out of bed as something will trigger panic If someone can relate to this then I virtually plead for a comment or chat I feel like I am losing control of my thoughts and emotions and this goes for sober life as much as when I drink,Depression
I am currently in my 20s and I still live at home with my family I came out as nonbinary to them around late December of 2020 My brother did not take it well Ever since then I have been hearing him spew homophobic transphobic sexist and racist rhetoric almost every single day he is made fun of me to his friends when he thinks I am not listening My mother has not done anything about it She tells me that he is an adult so there is nothing she can do to get him to change his beliefs she will tell me that I need to speak with him to smooth things over I do not think that burden should be on the shoulders of the person being harmed to initiate that conversation He does not feel any guilt about the things he says it is only gotten worse over time My mother says she supports me but I do not feel supported at all when she does not stand up for me at all only urging me to seek help and to eventually talk to my brother She said she does not want to choose sides with her own children Which I understand is hard but it makes me feel so suicidal whenever I think about itI do not feel welcome anywhere anymore I used to at least feel a little bit welcome here at home but even now that is goneI have always been out of place my whole life anywhere I have ever been I have several fairly severe mental health issues that have made day to day life very difficult for me I dropped out of college years ago I currently work at a supermarket with no end to it in sight I do not work very many hours because of the mental illnesses I have made worse by the severe symptoms I had due to long Covid I cannot afford to move out anytime soon I am also about to be too old to no longer qualify for being covered by my mothers health insurance in a few months I am afraid that I will struggle to pay for my own health once again and that it will only set me back in terms of finally moving out and becoming an adult It was very expensive to pay for my psychiatrist visits before I was able to be covered under my mothers insurance I am terrified to have to start all over again with a new doctor or to have to go any period of time without the mood stabilizers antianxiety medication and ADD medications that make it even a little bit possible to function If I lose my medicine I might be dead for real I am afraid to seek a therapist due to the fact that I am about to lose the insurance coverage I do not want to get attached to a therapist only to not be able to afford seeing them anymore I also have trauma about therapy stemming from a past therapist who told me I was never sexually abused when I came forward to her one session and told her that I thought I might have been raped I do not know what is happened to me anymore maybe she was right all alongI am sorry I have struggled with suicidal thoughts for over half of my life but never before have these thoughts felt so real I do not have any long term plans or goals anymore I had plans to travel but Covid ruined that Even now that things are starting to pick back up I do not really care about traveling anymore I am an artist and had ideas for long term projects I wanted to make These ideas do not matter anymore either I never start anything and I never finish anything because my ADD gets in the way I used to have hobbies and things I enjoyed doing but nothing is enjoyable or rewarding anymore Every day is the same I wake up in the afternoon work a few days a week at my night shift job get home and eat a shitty meal work on my art in the most inefficient and energy consuming way possible fall asleep after the sun is up maybe for 35 hours a day or 10 hrs on a bad day Rinse and repeat I am too old to be living like an overgrown 13 year old but here I am I leech off of my mothers resources I seek attention and pity because I decided adults did not pay enough attention to me as a child I make everything into a much bigger issue than it ever needed to beComing out as nonbinary was ultimately so inconsequential I asked for a change in pronouns but almost no one has used them I came out because I wanted to live an authentic life but I have regretted it every single day since I started hearing my brother say horrible things on a daily basis Everyday I do not feel welcome in my own home and I wish I were deceased I do not have any active plans at the moment to take my life but I do not know if I see myself living any longer than a year from now I am exhausted and empty and there is no joy in my life I feel this is a battle I am going to end up losing I never should have been nonbinary or ADD or mentally ill or stupid I am sorry I will just go to bed I guess The suicidal ideations do not feel so hollow anymore,Suicidal
I know the title for this post is strange but this is truly how I feel and have been feeling for a while now I suffer from severe depression and anxiety I also have OCD and autism so it makes my life a little bit harder than normal Through all of the struggles and dark times I have I cannot stop thinking about how much I want someone anyone to just hold me in their arms and give me a long hug It probably would not help in the long term but it would just be a temporary relief for me with the way I am feeling For someone to just hug me for a minute would make so much of a difference you would not believe but unfortunately I do not have anyone around me right now who could do that Like I said I would not just be permanently healed from this but it would be a temporary fix at least Sorry for this weird post but I just wanted to vent a little Thanks for reading I think a hug would make me feel better,Depression

I am writing this post to seek advice guidance and emotional support on an obvious issue that I can longer ignore which is that I am 31 years old and I have never had a girlfriend I am of East Indian descent however I grew up in California I have been told that numerous times that I am a goodlooking guy and some people are even shocked to find that I have never had a girlfriend before Throughout much of my adult life I have been overlooked by girls I have seen Indian guys score girls yet I would be left with nothing and it often makes me think just What exactly is it about these guys that make them particularly appealing What exactly do these guys have that I do not I have a fair complexion for an Indian so I am quite often told that I do not look Indian but rather a Hispanic or middle eastern which irritates me I am very insecure about my figure as I believe that it is the sole reason that people have never respected me I am 58 with a slender build which makes me look a lot younger than my actual age I could easily pass for 22 Many of these Indian guys may be taller than me61 however they are not exactly the most refined of people they are very callous and rude Many times where girls have expressed interest in me there has always been some jealous male that has ruined it for me I have tried using dating sites such as Tinder and much to my chagrin I have never matched even once in the past two years that I have been using the app For a while I stopped caring by reassuring myself that I can live without a girlfriend but unfortunately I am reaching an age where I need to find someoneampx200BI ought to mention that I would prefer to date a girl outside of my ethnicity I must profess that anytime I see a brown guy with a white girl I become infuriated with jealousy because I often think that if that brown guy can score a white girl why cannot I What exactly does that brown guy have that I do not I would not feel the same way if the guy were White Yellow or Black but only BrownOne could contend that there may be something about myself that I could change and I completely agree however one attribute about the physique that I have not been able to change is my height and I know that women do care about that they are lying if they tell you that it is not important Consequently I am strongly considering undergoing cosmetic limb lengthening surgery which would essentially make me 5 inches taller and put me at 61 and not to mention people would not bully me and women would be more likely to express interest in meIf I were a brown guy standing at 61 and not 58 I would be respected and not bullied as much as I have throughout my life I am constantly told by women that I look like a little boy and not like a grown man and that is simply because of my small buildIt is my misfortune to have been dealt with a very bad genetic hand at birth however I do plan to redeem by making myself taller to improve the quality of my life and ultimately ensure my happinessI am very miserable deep inside and with each passing day I realize more and more just how miserable I am deep down inside I often ask what is the point of life Help and Guidance needed,Suicidal

hi i m f and my partner guy is also i say partner because i ve had mixed message about being in a relationship or not recently with him and i think this is a factor to my anxiety too fyi i have had bad anxiety since an abusive relationship at university and another one where i had a bf cheat multiple time my parent did not have a healthy relationship when i wa younger and where both not very present till my later teenage year i don t suffer anxiety in general but my relationship anxiety ha only got worse the older i get current situ we ve been dating month about week ago his twin brother died suddenly which wa tragic accident they were extremely close and he s been very unemotional about it all hasn t cried and been very rational before we got together we were friend before although i always knew he wanted more than that he d asked me on a few date in the past which i declined because he isn t usually someone i would go for but personality win me over everytime he wa also very consistent over text and the quality of conversation wa always really good which a someone with r anxiety the reassurance that someone is interested really help and usually attracts me more to them this ha since faded massively even before the passing of his brother and i find even some day the conversation is a 0th of what it used to be we ve discussed this and a lot of the time he say it s due to work and just over time not needing to keep up this same level because he is no longer chasing me because of my anxiety the long period of lack of communication i struggle with and my brain start to panic i find myself regularly checking his instagram who he follows what picture he s liked it s not healthy and i m trying to stop because it never help but almost become like an ocd since his brother passed he s shown me glimpse of seeing a future together he introduced me to some friend double date and his parent sister which i don t feel you would do if you didn t see a relationship potential he s said he would have asked me to be his gf when we should have gone on holiday the week after his brother passed but since i ve had mixed comment from whether we are in a relationship or still dating i find myself in a constant spiral atm due to the lack of communication which he say a factor is the grieving this is hard to overcome i feel awful to keep bringing up i need more in this situation i e if he can t text due to busy day can he call me more he agrees but never follows through consistently so every week i m cycling the anxiety cry worry that s now affecting my work and day to day in this situation i don t know what to do the anxiety is becoming worse and worse i don t want to have to keep bringing it up to him because of everything going on in his personal life but he doesn t seem to be meeting any emotional need for me and i m worried i won t cope long term with someone who can t reassure me i also feel guilty for wanting more from him i do hope it will get better in time a he is still in shock grieving process but it s hard to tell how would you handle this situation do you continue to suffer in silence with the anxiety in order to stop putting pressure on the other person when they are grieving or would ending the situation be better i wouldn t want to do this i m very happy with him but i feel like in a short space of time this ha been intense and draining,Depression

The third appointment in a row where I have not been examined So I am well known to my gp practice recently due to a lot of issues with depression and anxiety Long story short I wasnt fit to work and was very much suffering on the antidepressant that I had been put on I was suicidal and close to the edge having panic attacks on the daily etc I have since come off the antidepressant and it has been thw best decision I have ever made for myself The anxiety is still there and always has been and I suspect always will be but I am functional again I couldnt even open my work email or answer an unexpected knock on the door without risking a panic attack and now Im back at work In the last month I have been experiencing intermittent stabbing shooting pains I have a history of chronic muscle tightness and pain I am currently in physio for trapezius and neck pain I also have midback tightness I have previously had my legs in casts and afterwards splints to manipulate my calves into the correct position I know what a muscle cramp feels like I know what a pulled muscle feels like I know what a muscle spasm feels like I know what DOMs feels like This new pain is on another level and it is vastly different in nature I cant sleep I cant lie comfortably I cant concentrate properly I will involuntarily have to change position and grab the effected limb when the pain comes on The pains that I am experiencing are not in the usual suspects of my calves or backneck but in my groinarmpitsideback of my thigh and glute areaankleelbow My Google history is looking pretty crazy as a result I have seen three different doctors at my gp practice about this because I am extremely distressed Not one of them has examined me All that has happened is that I have been counselled about psychosomatic symptoms being a thing and encouraged to get back on antidepressants I feel like nobody is taking me seriously and this being the UK GPs are very much the gatekeepers to other services While I would be willing to pay for answers if it comes to it I wouldnt even know where to start because I have no idea what could be causing all this Im crying as Im typing right now from a stabbing pain in my groin I just cannot believe that its all in my head when my mental health is so much better now than it was,Anxiety/Stress

I do not think the worst part of losing a friend is actually losing them I think the worst part is seeing them so happy without you there To see them all hanging out and having fun with no thought of you Or when something funny or amazing happens and the people you used to tell it to no longer talk to you so you cannot turn to them And the absolute worst part is when you realise that they never really invited you to out to begin with and you start to realise all the lies they told you about why you could not come Seeing them all out together and you cannot really say anything or feel any type of way because that means that you are either too needy or have serious fomo Worst part,Depression

I am edging closer and closer to killing myself I have never ever thought that I would actually do it but lately I am starting to doubt that conviction I am almost 40 and things are not getting better I live with my parents again for the umpteenth time in my life after breaking up for the umpteenth time with the woman I have been with for umpteen years and losing the umpteenth job because of what I call mental health issues but most other people call laziness I am 30 thousand dollars in debt in student loans the schooling for which has never helped me get a single job I have never made much more than minimum wage and I have never even put a dent in paying off the loans What a waste of time and money school wasI have violent thoughts towards myself all the time and often I find myself thinking about violence against faceless entities like the government or the rich I have sought mental health help for many many years in many many forms and there is nothing that seems to help me cope with my lack of success I am on pills now and they make me feel less angry but not less sad I am really thinking that I may not be able to hold my resolve against my growing instinct that I would be better off just ending thingsWhat should I do Going to the hospital never yields results I have done that a number of times and quite frankly I do not need to be put on a 48 hour watch I am not crazy I am at the end of my rope I have no more fucks to give I was going to tell my parents or my ex how I was feeling but I just keep stopping myself because I do not feel like putting the burden on them So I searched suicide on reddit and here I am I hope I do not get the typical internet responses but I suppose putting myself out there like this invites it no matter what TLDR never thought I would do it life seems like it only gets worse probably will do it Probably Going to Do it,Suicidal

Does this just sound like anxietydepression Hey I know you guys arent doctors and I am waiting for a call back from psychiatrists but I was wondering if any of you guys have had similar symptoms and could give me some insight I feel like the way most people describe there anxiety is a lot different than how mine feels ampx200B Sometimes I just get these episode where everything gets scary I just feel confused and very on edge and everything makes me jumpy My life feels almost like a horror movie during these times Usually a small sound such as my fridge PC anything really will seem to grow louder and seem eeriespooky My thoughts go down this loop of Do I have some sort of serious chronic mental illness will I feel this way forever will it get worse And of course I try to shut these thoughts down and sometimes can but the feelings are still there and very real Sometimes I get very weird and super brief thoughts of doing rash things flipping the fuck out on my grandma for example It feels like theres an anchor in my stomach and sometimes but not usually Ill get shaky and have heart palpitations These episodes last for well over 15 minutes and I never feel normal afterwards so I get annoyed when people label them as simple panic attacks because they way other people describe theres I feel as though mine are a lot different ampx200B Another thing to add is over the summer I did acid for the first time and I always read that acid will onset any mental illness you are going to get in the future So I often fear that I did acid and fucked myself over because of it but nobody on either side of the family has a history of schizophrenia or anything of the sort ampx200B If anyone could give me some insight or share what their crippling anxiety feels like I would love to hear it Thanks guys nn,Anxiety/Stress

i have been suffering for eight long month after a girl i thought would be interested in being my girlfriend ended thing and left me out to dry it wa a pretty short span of dating and hooking up we talked during the summer and only saw each other in person for a few week but the aftermath ha been the worst thing i ve ever gone through in my entire life i have alienated myself from her because i couldn t stop texting her and asking what i did wrong or saying thing i thought i did to make her not interested and expect her to confirm i am on a no contact basis with her now which is probably for the best because i don t think she even cared that much about me to begin with i can t handle the fluidity of dating how people can just leave something if it isn t working out for them for whatever reason and not know what that reason is i ve already come up with every possible situation or reason in my head that it didn t work out and it s honestly been driving me over the edge since last summer i can t take this anymore luckily it s never gotten so bad that i threatened her with suicide because i remember her saying she had an ex who did that to her and it sound like an awful thing to have done to you but that thought did cross my mind where i wanted to present that a an ultimatum to her if she couldn t just tell me what the exact reason or reason were she wanted to end it but i would never actually do that due to it being shitty to put another person through it s not enough for me to accept that we lived more than three hour from each other or she had a bad long term relationship end and wasn t trying to get into anything serious or she told me she wa feeling suffocated by me it s like the spongebob episode with patrick s secret box i just want so badly to hear what it might have been like she would tell her girl friend behind closed door no matter how bad it might sting or hurt but i know i ll never know precisely what she wa thinking it is so difficult to just move on or let it go like people always say for dating situation like this that to me just sound impossible i just hate dating i hate how some people have such ease jumping from date to date or going on multiple date with multiple people at once or talking to many people at one time it just make me feel so overwhelmed and upset that that seems to be the norm in society i can t take it it make me want to die just knowing that s what i m going to have to deal with if i want to have any hope of finding someone to be with let alone get over this last girl,Depression

i know they have good intention but lot of the time they make me feel worse i don t like it when they ask too many question when i withdraw yet when i go to tell them my actual problem they indirectly tell me to get over it and don t think im depressed sometimes it seems like my mood is an inconvenience for them so they want me to be happy so they can be happy it s draining i m tired of them being nosy when when i need to be alone stop asking me to who i m talking to stop asking me what i m doing when i m not doing anything stop looking at my stuff and asking me question stop getting upset with me for being in a bad mood or trying to force me to be happy again i can t this is why i hate socializing with anyone in general it take up too much energy that i don t have and i m tired of having to hide whatever this heaviness i m feeling inside to make others happy i m tired of being the caretaker and human note pad to vent at all day i m tired of putting on a mask and pretending to be happy when i feel like garbage i hate myself i m tired all the time i feel like a failure and a waste of space i just want to be alone i don t want anyone to look at me,Depression

Why is selfishness and greed so rampant in society Why is everyone a megalomaniac Why does everyone want attention Why do most people do more harm than good Why is humanity not there in us humans Why does everyone think the other person is always wanting something from them Why does discrimination exist Be it based on colour religion economic status social status anything Why do people like to abuse someone verbally or in any other form just because they can Why can we not get rid of this I do not know Maybe there is something wrong with me Why is this world full of shitty people,Depression

Just needed to vent and I honestly cannot say this to anyone IRL The bar is this coming Tuesday I have not studied in any capacity I just could not bring myself to commit I was barely taking care of myself as it was And that is the thing I cannot even say that I want to kick myself or that I regret it My mental health was literally just so poor that if I actually participated in the study schedulegrind I feel I would have been worse off for it For context this summer is the only time I have gone days without brushing my teeth and struggled to get out of my bed I have had two major depressive periods in the past and neither time was I at this level of neglect I wish I would have just signed up for the later date but that is not what you are suppose to do You are supposed to graduate and immediately study fulltime for 8 weeks I even started early technically but I put in one full days worth of work and juststopped I said oh after graduation when its official to start is when Ill pick it back upbut I did not And very early on I already felt like I was so behind I had people asking me what my progress percentage of my bar prep course was at during graduation we did not even need to technically start yet and it freaked me out I basically decided at the beginning of July that I was too behind with only 4 weeks left so it was not possible and I was going to fail And I gave up even pretending to schedule studyingPart of the issue iswas covid I felt like a real law student with real obligations benefits and consequences before this Then we went online for the remainder of my degree program I instantly lost focus and drive None of it felt real or worthwhile anymore I could now BS my way through my classes school had relaxed grading policies and when it came time to actually learn for the bar I was incredibly overwhelmedAnd hell even if I studied studied there was never a guarantee that I would pass but there is absolutely no chance for me to pass now I do not care what any of my peers have to say about me not passing because well I did not actually study and regardless of that peer pressure just has not ever been a motivator for me I wish I did care what they thought in actuality because I am completely lacking motivation My family is truly supportive and I know already they will not think badly of me But they have checked in practically everyday And I lie and say I studied when I did not I cannot tell my friends because I know they all are studying by the stuff they send me All this to say I feel very alone at this time in my lifeI cannot back out of the exam now so I am treating it like a practice test as I have heard others suggest I can and will retake it next year I already know that I am changing my environment so I will not be so isolated which will help I know in the end everything will probably be okay I think it speaks loads that even as I am writing this with the test days away I do not have that much anxiety This entire time I have been numb I am sure I will probably freak out during the test I hope that this experience will actually motivate me in the end If you read all this thanks for listening I am going to fail the bar exam,Depression

Years of Random Sudden amp Violent Vomiting Anyone Else Have Similar Experiences I am wondering if anyone else has had similar symptoms and had any luck correcting it I am 39 and have been suffering from random vomiting spells in the mornings for approximately 15 years I have seen many doctors and specialists without any luck finding a cause They have performed many tests and everything showed up negative or inconclusive It can come in waves but is fairly consistent For the last two weeks I have thrown up 6 out of the 14 days 43 of the time Sometimes itll be for a few days in a row sometimes I can go a month without a spell and have experienced it multiple times daily for over a month at a time The worst was about three times daily for a month and caused me to lose 45 lbs that month due to no appetite The majority of the time it happens in the mornings right after I wake up and before I get into the shower It can happen throughout the day as well at random Its fast uncontrollable violent and usually produced a white foamy substance However I had my gallbladder removed in November due to gallstones That didnt fix the problem and the docs thought it would Ever sense the gallbladder removal all I throw up is yellow stomach bile Today it went from yellow to a green color After getting sick I usually have a pain of about a 4 out of 10 right in the middle of my torso I find myself applying pressure with my hand to relieve the pain Usually have to lay in the fetal position after a bad spell without an appetite until the end of the day or night Some of the exams that have been done without luck is Celiac Disease the breath test for H Pylori Barium Swallow test upper Endoscopy Colonoscopy ultrasounds of my gallbladder amp liver gallbladder removal MRI brain scan for tumors Again it happens usually in the mornings with gagging and dry heaving until something comes up Usually there is no food or liquids other than the white foam and stomach bile If anyone else has experienced similar symptoms and found relief please let me know Thanks,Anxiety/Stress

When we were still together23rd of december 2019 my then boyfriend killed himself by hanging in an psyciatric ward A week before this he had taken a lot of benzos and i had been at a night shift So when i came home in the morning i went straight to bed I noticed he had fallen asleep on the couch but i did not want to wake him up 6h later i wake up and go to pee and whatever you do when you wake up When i passed the trash next to the kitchen i noticed all these emtpy benzo boxes I rushed to the couch and he was drooling and could barely keep his eyes open so i smacked his face not as in abusive but trying to wake him up and calling his name he was kind of awake but like a zombie So i tried to get him to stand up and go to the bed to sleep it off i was going to call for an ambulance but a month before this he had taken a box of paracet and i called the ambulance and he got so mad at me but i did not care about him getting mad i was going to call but as soon as he got up on his feet he wanted to have sex I tried to lay him down and told him we could not because i was tired etcetc not trying to put it on him and that he was a fucking zombie at the time But he pushed me to the bed and held me down i almost could not believe it cus a minute ago he could barely stand and now he was pushing me on the bed basicslly trying to do it against my willHe could not get an erection because of all the benzo and i was relived But he started crying saying he was not a man cus he could not get his dick up so i started comforting him Telling him we could watch a movie or anything else to get him distracted so i could call the ambulance i know i should have done that when i saw the boxes in the trash cannot do much about it now But his manhood was ruined so he needed to go out and take some amphetamine And when i tried to block the bedroom door he took his hand around my troat and squeesed and pulled me away and threw me on the floor He then looked for his wallet and phone so me being filled with adrenaline got up and blocked the door going to the hallway He then toon a knife and pressed it against my throat and said I have stabbed my brother imagine what i could do to you and i just remeber telling him fine alright I will move away from the door now and i did and he walked off I looked out the window until i could not see him anymore and when i could not it was as if my whole body just went numb I remember falling to the ground because i could not feel me kneeslegsanything waist down and cried while calling my best friend who is on the other side of the country She had to guide me on who to contact cus shw knew i had made two new friends in the city So i called them both 1st had visitors so i just hung up called my bff again and she told me to call the other person my now boyfriend and my exs best friend and he had to guide me through the phone on what to do step by step He told me to get a bag how many of different clothes and to get out of there and he would meet me at the 1st guy i called apartment I stayed there for a week i did not dare to answer my then bf calls texts or even tell anyone where i was cus i was scared of telling any one else what had happened So i turned off my phone A week later my friend got a call from the police cus they knew i was there And they told me it was critical and i had to get to the hospitalHe died that day and i was planning to follow him to the other side Both me and his best friend my now boyfriend idk found each other in grief Lifted each other up we understood each other and what we went trough so we fell in love and all of a sudden we both wanted to live for each other It happened fast not going to lie 2 months later we were in a relationshipNow my exs family is blaming me for his death even tho i had already saved him 5 times from suicide in 10months before i met him he had tried to take his life 30 times or more Idk why i let his family make me feel like shit but it fucking sucks and it fucking hurts knowing that these people knew what he had done how many times he had tried before and now i have to suffer from it I am still with his best friend and he honestly saved my life I know i should be happy with just that but i cry everytime I am alone and i talkcry to empty rooms and empty chairs basically shouting at my exs ghost Its everything from telling him I am sorry to yelling how much i hate him for what he put me througIdk what i needed from this post maybe just to share it cus his familu does not believe me They believe i cheated cus i got together with his bff 2 months after his deathIf someone made it this far please tell me how to move away from this I am so tired of feeling like it really was my fault My ex killed himself,Suicidal
I am a 27m Pansexual and Autistic Growing up I was bullied alot but I can recall having happy moments even happy moments with my mother but as I grew my mother and I started to become more argumentative and hostile and drastically effected my mental standing Everyday was mental struggle to find happiness and I would always retreat to my room with my video games and anime and it helped me ignore it but then came the Dark Day an argument so drastic that I had to kick myself out to my wifes girlfriend then house For awhile I felt great My mothers hostility felt like the Moon from Legend of Zelda Majoras Mask and leaving finally made it disappear Come Present day my anxiety had risen things are harder to enjoy and negative thoughts ruminate to the point where I cannot have a day with out hearing my mothers voice or imagining terrible scenarios around my screwups and it is affecting my relationship with my wife who battles against depression and is possibly autistic I feeling like I am losing the war for my mind and thoughts of running away to not bother anyone ever again CONSTANTLY creep up This has spiraled into beast that just will not die I do not know what to do and I have come here as a start because idea how to ask for help and have actively avoided looking for help because I am too ashamed The Root of a Losing War,Depression

I am not exactly sure where to ask that If there is a better subreddit for it let me know it and I will go there Here is the storyI began to be in depression at aroud 12 for no specific reason that I can recall At 17 I try to strangulate myself to death during my sleep At 18 I tried to asphyxiate myself in a car Nobody noticed it At 20 I shot myself in the mouth with a 22 long rifle It was harder to hide so family and friend finally knew it I was incredibly lucky since I was not paralysed or disfigured and had very little sequels This I can understand it is biology and a huge amount of luck What I cannot seem to explain though is that since then I am not depressed anymore and it is been 15 years I had my up and downs depending on my life situation of course but not the dark thoughts everyday that nothing could make disappear So does anybody has a theory on why I am not depressed anymore it is just curiosity and nothing will change if I find an answer but I did not manage to by myself in those 15 years Thanks And to be clear I know I was incredibly lucky both mentally and physically and of course I would never ever suggest a suicide attempt to end depression I was depressed Tried to kill myself Was not depressed anymore Why,Depression

could not really find the perfect title its more about the process of finding someone which I would consider dating and I was wondering if someone here felt the same or experienced the same and might give me some adviceSo I had this happen a few times in the last year where I get to know someone and it feels like I am completely falling in love with the other person even tho I barely know them just because it feels nice being around them But it really hit me a week ago I met this girl at a party and we had a one night stand sorta We could not sleep alot so we just layed next to each other talked and kissed for like 6 hours till 11amI have not felt better in the last year I just felt safe being with her When I woke up that night I did not think about how I wanted to sleep again or how I would just like to kill myself my mind was at rest atleast for a whiledo not get me wrong I liked that girl but I barely know her and she is probably not even really my type but I still feel like I would do anything for her or for being with her again and more often Its not rational but this happens so often although this time the feeling is so much stronger I feel like I am being so heavily influence by the fact that I am not feeling good at all This makes things like that so much stronger and I cannot think rational I cannot distinguish between the feeling of me actually being into someone or just being into the feeling I get when I am around them And you could probaly change that girl with any other random one and Id feel the same for just that person Just because I did not think about blowing my brains out while next to her I feel like she is the oneAnyways thanks for reading Similar storysthoughts and advice very much appreciated Thanks in advance and sry for my probably very unstructured thoughts and repetitve writing cannot even remeber things i did 20 seconds ago so writing is hard lmao fuck me Dating with depression,Depression

I was 12 when I realized I just fucking want to dieIn the 10 years since then there was not a single day that I did not regret just killing myself right back then Yes I lived on But I had already died inside This sounds so dramatic but it is the best description of things Anyone around me can see this Not like anyone would actually care they probably think I have some mental retardation Honestly I probably do I have not progressed much since then My personality has not changed significantly I have not experienced much anything I did experience felt dull Like alcohol It just raises my heart beat and makes it hard to walk Or sex it is nice but the same way as food is nice It does not give any meaning to my life The only exception is mdma the only thing that has made me feel something in ten years But anyways I really just feel like a ghost Maybe I am who knows It would explain a lot of things I am really just a she will of a person Like sorry I do not mean to one up anyone on depression But when I hear stories of people that are depressed and just play online games all day or watch netflix youtube etc It just reminds me how fucked up I am Because I have to FORCE myself to do any of those things Anything that is not lying in bed all day maybe scrolling through reddit to distract myself I do not feel like continuing writing this But anyways if I did not have a loving mother I would have ended this by now there is nothing else keeping me here Anyone other than my mum will do just fine when I am gone I did not make a difference in anyones life after all I have been selfish only thinking about my feelings and letting anxiety keep me from doing anything good Trapped in this fucking existence because mum would be sad,Depression

I am just going to go ahead and embarrass myself off the bat and let you all know I cried at the end of the empathy and sympathy video from the rules I just signed up for Reddit not long ago and it makes me feel welcome and safe that is when I started searching for this subI had no idea that there were two people most of the time that recognized your problems the empath and the sympath I 100 believe I am an empathetic person When I tell people that I understand what they feel I can literally feel it I make other peoples problems my problems I decide Okay this person is clearly over barren with their difficulties that if maybe I just take a little weight off of their shoulders they could breathe After all I would want someone to do that for mePeople can never really reciprocate the feelings correctly I know that sounds odd There are no wrong ways to feel but something about the demeanor of those i help really tears me down I am slowly giving giving giving until I am all outI can tell that recently my depression is worsening I cannot tell if it is a hormonal wave but it is so extreme I have not showered in like two and a half days But its been longer before I am trying to find my footing but I can feel myself mentally drift Just a morning or two ago I was incredibly happy I stayed up all night just to clean the house for my mom She is a handful another post for later My mom now is so cruel and treats me no less than a cleaning lady I had a relationship with her when I was smaller but she tries to get me to hang out with her I never stay long Everyone I have ever met loves my mom The only people who really know what is going on is my boyfriend and my dad We label her as narcissistic because I did not recognize she was so mean because I was so used to it Today I was crying for many reasons First it was because my anxiety was bad and I did not really have anyone to talk to Then it was because I felt guilty that I accidentally kept my exs pictures in the My Eyes Only section of snapchat my boyfriend did not care as long as I deleted them I think I might be bipolar I feel like I am blowing things out of proportion when I say that but I might need to be reevaluated By a psychologist not a therapist that will befriend my mom and become BFFS WITH I played myself and lied to her the entire time I was her client I was already diagnosed with depression and anxiety and was taking lexapro but stopped because I started taking a whole 20 mg pill that was supposed to be cut in half My dumbass But when I took it consistently 3 weeks in a row in rehab I hated how it trapped me in my own brain This post was very hard to make and I do not think I can retype it if it gets taken down bc its unfocused I am so sorry I do not care if you leave advice or not for me as long as you read my post All I wanted was to be heard because I could not express my true self If you need more context please just ask I am sorry again for my ADD rambling I know there are some major things I am leaving out I am such a fucking crybaby,Depression

well to be honest I do not even know why I am here but I just need somewhere I can voice my thoughts as I feel like they are building in my head to the stage that I would rather talk to my self than others it may sound like I am exaggerating right but I spend soo much time alone that even when I am with others id rather not be this is my fault either I was such a funny kid class clown so popular in school and even after I finished school too but that all changed when I was shipped over seas by my mum I cannot lie and say know I do not see that it was for my benefit I could have simply died had I stayed there and for a parent that is enough reason but to send me somewhere like that and treat me the way they did really stripped me for humanity I saw things I should not have and that is when the thoughts started I was locked up for about 7 months over seas as my family thought it would help me but there is where I create a version of life in my head and know I cannot escape it my life is finally going good I have worked soo hard for that but mentally I am suffering soo much I cannot tell anyone this in real life because why would humans care they never cared when I really needed them and know it feels like if they do care is because they want something and also I promised my self that I will never be vulnerable again in this life which is another reason I can never tell anyone so I smile at the few people I do see but in saying ALLL OF THIS I do want to make friends and there is apart of me that wants to be accepted in someone is life as I really feel like I have never belonged I would love some tips or maybe books to read that may help me I REALLY FEEL LIKE I AM DROWNING Why I made this account,Depression

Does anyone else have a rotating portfolio of health worries Ive had a number of scares in the past year since Ive identified my health anxiety I wouldnt call any of them explicitly painful but theres a distracting discomfort thats hard to shake and when a panic attack happens the discomfort is magnified a hundredfold My mind tends to focus on one of them at a time my chest my abdominal area my tooth filling and my testicle Doctors have already told me that each of these areas are fine and Im mostly mentally stable with that but when my anxiety flares up it tells me that the doctors didnt do enough tests they just brushed it off as imagined anxiety pains or IBS because Im young and the probability of something serious is low Its like my anxiety constantly picks at my defenses to see if it can get a footing and crawl into my brain I used to be a WebMD nut that would look up every odd symptom and have panic attacks I still get freaked out by the odd thing that I have a brain tumor every time I misspell a word or I flub some speech for example But Im mostly sticking to the ones I know nowadays Does anyone else have a portfolio of halfresolved worries like this Or does your anxiety mostly conjure up new symptoms,Anxiety/Stress

Mitral valve prolapse anxiety or something else causing these symptoms Ok so Ive been having some issues with my heart for about 6 years Im turning 19 this year and Ive been to the cardiologist 3 times The first time i went i was told i had mitral valve prolapse and that it was nothing to worry about The second time i actually went to the er because i was experiencing shortness of breath along with a weird pulse and chestarm pain The doctor there said its just anxiety and nothing else and only told me to get some food supplements After that my symptoms would come and go and about a year and a half i went to the cardiologist i went the first time again This time she told me i have mitral valve prolapse with leakage to the pulmonary valve and a distention of the aorta in the Valsalva sinus keep in mind Im trying to translate my doctors note in English so I might have made some mistakes Anyway after she finished the echo and the heart ultrasound she told that most of the things i experience are due to MVP and anxiety and that Im okay but that I should also avoid things like coffee and energy drinks Im sure she explained things with more detail but my mind was pretty blank due to the constant anxiety I had these days lol I still have shortness of breath and some pains in the chest and left arm that come and go along with back pains I also get heart palpitations and a weird heart rate that is sometimes too fast and other times too slow I went to have a blood test and an ultrasound for my thyroid a month before since my TSH was higher than normal and they came out ok and was told that I should do the tests again after 6 months I just want to know if i should worry about the other notes my doctor wrote despite my mitral valve prolapse and if these symptoms i experience have anything to do with my aorta or the pulmonic valve leakage or even my high thyroid hormone Maybe my anxiety makes my symptoms seem so serious and Im reading into this too much,Anxiety/Stress

I just found this community and I am just curious as to how does depression feel Sometimes my feelings are really really strong and i feel like i cannot control them my mind gets filled with negative stuff but I have always tried to see the positive side of everything I rly do not think I have any reason to be sad or depressed I really am happy with my life and the people I love surrounding meBut sometimes out of nowhere without reason or for really insignificant stuff I suddenly feel lonely like no one cares about me deep down I know that is not true but idk why it keeps getting to me every now and then I am an overthinker and I have tried to change that for me and the people i love bc it has brought me problems all my life this past year i have calmed my anxiety and the way I worry about stuff I am feeling a lot better But something I have never told anyone in my life is how these negative thoughts come to me sometimes as if I am not worthy or just do not deserve to be here it is weird I just feel like no one would understand idk if it is actually depression or just random normal sad thoughts But I do not want to tell anyone I care about bc I think it would worry them and that I would destroy what i have with the people I love that they would think I am crazy or something and leave me that they will get tired of me i just try to ignore my bad feelings and see the positive side realizing that my reasons to be sad are not valid but it is hard and i do not think i have depression but sometimes it comes to my mind that maybe i have and do not want to admit it Idk I just do not want ppl to change their view of me or how they treat me or make them feel guilty for what I feel randomly but idk if that is just making me close off make a barrier with everyone instead of facing what my heart feels So ye I just feel stupid because i do actually have everything to be happy and I truly am i am not insecure of myself either I am happy with everyone that is with me right now well my friends let me down a lot but apart from that it is all good my family my bf and the few friends I trust But doubts suddenly invade my mind and do not let me see stuff as great as it actually is So ye idk what to call this or how to overcome it sometimes it is not always but when it happens it really puts me down in a fking hole What does depression feel like,Depression
i feel like I am either on the verge of a break through or that I will be stuck like this forever the issue seems to go very deep almost on a fundamental nature you get what you get in life and you make mistakes and you have moments of happiness but none of it is ever in your control I cannot help but feel like I am imprisoned In a body And that I desperately want life to mean so much more or to see a truth to get some kind relief that is not drug related for once but the suffering goes on how do you stop hating yourself,Depression

Same illness for two years in a row Need advice Could be TMI but here it goes So this started in March 2016 I started noticing that just before I peed I felt a sting every time before I passed urine This when on for 23 weeks then I got really scared and when to the doctor They prescribed a urine test and also prescribed some medicines for UTI The results came back negative for a UTI A couple of days later I had a really upset stomach with nausea and my roommate had to take me to the hospital And I mentioned to the doctor about my prior visit He prescribed another urine test checked my penis for any issues I also felt some tightness in my foreskin He couldnt find any issues And this urine test came back negative too I was starting to panic as I the situation was not getting better So I had to fly back home to see another doctor i was in college btw Another doctor another urine test and the result nothing nada zilch It was same for some more time and then I started feeling gassy along with the initial symptoms I got prescribed some gas relief medicines and that was it All in all this went for couple more months then the sting before peeing gradually went away So now a little over a year later in June 2017 The same symptoms returned And the same progression of symptoms occurred the stinging sensation and few weeks later the gassiness etc But it was worse this time around I had a very bad heart attack scare with symptoms like pain in the chest my left arm going completely numb and gassiness So I was rushed to the hospital where they performed an ECG I had a fever too They concluded that nothing was wrong with me Oh yeah I had another urine test a couple of days earlier and it was negative Amidst all this chaos I had to travel and it had a 32 hour travel time So obviously I wasnt looking forward to it And my nightmare came true I finished that journey with constant gassiness nausea and uneasiness So I guess Im not in a hurry to ever take on that long a journey ever again in my life So these symptoms finally improved but painstakingly slowly 4 months So my concern now is that it gonna be April soon that means I might get this stupid mysterious illness again What do I do I feel about 70 just might be my head which is causing all of this anxiety Also i feel I was misdiagnosed everytime The doctors always brushed it off with Your results are fine dont worry about it,Anxiety/Stress

Told a very close friend of 4years that i had been depressed for a while now and spoke about my ongoing problems with self harm a few weeks ago They then proceeded to call me stupid that idk what I am doing and that I am just being an idiot overreacting on things They also said that i will have worse problems in the future so i should not be depressed or self harm now Ik they were trying to comfort me and tough love me but it still felt like they did not really care as they have never talked to me since and when i have tried to mention something they then said it was a lot for them to deal with and did not want to deal with it Again i understand this it is very difficult to say to someone that you self harm and expect them to know how to handle it but now i feel like a burden speaking my issues with them Maybe i am selfish for expecting them to be there to talk to i do not know i just would have thought they would have at least checked up on me as i do with them and as how i am happy to help them and be there for a talk when they need one and because i have helped them I know it sounds selfish but i expected more as everyone says to tell someone and talk about it Am i bad for expecting more support from a friend,Depression

I realized today that I have no more control over my concious Maybe I never did But I do not have the confidence or energy left to delude myself into thinking I have control over my lifeI truly do not I do not know who I am because I have spent the past four years never changing or trying anything new Everything I have done was out of my own shortterm survival whether that may be work for school or trying to cope with stress through escapismSo here I am I am 18 faced with reality and I do not know how to comprehend it Once more I do not know myself I never had the selflove to take care of myself during my high school years I hated myself and destroyed a chance of forming an identity through my own fear and loathingI do not know how to describe myself I am many things but also absolutely nothing at all Pretentious as that sounds it illustrates the tenuous grasp I have of my own selfI do not know who I am I have vague ideas of who I want to be but I cannot do anything because I have no autonomy over my own feelingsI am in a constant state of inaction or drowning myself in escapism I have college to worry about I still have not chosen my classes but how could I I do not know who I am and any aspiration I have ever had I have never attained because of misfortune or inactionSo I give up I have been severly depressed for the last seven month Every day I wanted to die But this past month its gotten better Why Because of escapism and leisure Whenever I face reality I become depressed and scared I can only live through other peoples stories and dreamI daydream all the time I can never manifest anythingSo I give up I have no autonomy over this person I inhibit They feel like a different person entirely from me They will not relent with their bullshit bad habits and stagnation My spirit is different from my personI know I will never find selflove because that requires autonomy decision making and motivation I have none I feel deprived of anythingHow am I even supposed to find a romantic partner if I do not know myself I will always feel alienated from myself and othersLove is so beautiful but something I will never experienceI do not know where Ill be in a year let alone five but I will have made selfdestructive decisions like always Whether they be big or miniscule I have always been too selfless I do not mean that in a selfaggrandizing way but in a negative way I do not feel good about myselfThis makes me sound depressed and I probably am but the feeling is more akin to apathy Why even try if I will NEVER be happy with myself Always changing my mind always daydreaming Every day I change my mind about who I want to be so I am nobodyI am just here for the ride for wherever my mind takes me Down down down I just will not feel the intimacy and love that others doTLDR Anxiety killed me Selflove and acceptance are vital to a good life Life makes no sense I do not understand my feelings anymore,Depression

Anxiety Brain Eating Amoeba Ive had health anxiety for about 8 months now Ive always wanted to post here but have always been too sacred For me everything started with a scan my wife had and in the wait I started searching for possible causes and then started getting her symptoms At first it was pancreatic cancer then lun cancer the stomach cancer etc I have gotten help and have actually been partially hospitalized for my anxiety For my regular health got an abdominal ultrasound and all clear At about he 6 month mark I started eating persistent headaches and thats when thins got really bad At that point I was convinced I was dying so I went to my Dr and told her about the headaches Although I suffer from migraines and have had bouts of persistent headaches in the past she recommended a sinus x ray and a head mri just to be clear and so I could calm down Although the mri is this coming Wednesday I have been relatively stable for about 3 weeks until yesterday that is Yesterday I was cleaning out my lawnmower and accidentally got a little bit of carburetor cleaner in my forehead In order to make the sting go away I went to the hose and but some water in my forehead however some water went into my nose and now I cant stop thinking about the brain eating amoeba I live in PR so weather here is warm and I really cant function right now due to fear of the brain eating amoeba Any advice would be appreciated Tl DR Was doing good with nmy health anxiety until I accidentally got tap water up my nose,Anxiety/Stress
The hustle culture is pretty toxic I thought I need to hustle my way to success but what I learned next changed my life forever The hustle culture is pretty toxic I was being told that working 1012 hours a day constantly chasing after the next task and being totally drained afterwards not even able to enjoy a dinner with my family is the way to success And believe me Ive done that for way too long After quitting my 95 job and deciding to start my first coaching business I basically switched from working 8 hours a day 5 days a week to 12 hours a day 6 days a week Finally quit the rat race huh Quite frankly it felt like less pressure than doing the typical 95 at the beginning because I was really excited to work on my dream As the months passed I was getting deeper and deeper into the grind It got to a point where I would wake up at 900 am already thinking about work then work through the whole day and still be replying to my clients messages at 130 am lying in bed with my girlfriend My mind was constantly there at work At the dinner table during a walk with my partner even when skiing on vacation that I rarely took back then I was constantly experiencing this weird sense of guilt when I wasnt productive and even though my business was growing so was my anxiety stress and lack of satisfaction with life It eventually led to me getting sick so badly that it was a struggle to even reply to a clients message I was stressed out of my mind It felt like everything is going to collapse on me if I keep going down that route Finally I decided to take a real break I took a full 7 days off and decided to delete all the apps like Slack Messenger and Gmail from my phone which sounded absolutely crazy to me back then But man it felt liberating Something clicked inside me and finally I was able to let go of all the pressure and stress that were haunting me For the first time in months I experienced this deep sense of relief and inner peace By stepping out of this craziness I was able to notice how toxic and unhealthy it was How having healthy boundaries and balance in your life is key to actually enjoying what youre doing and what youre working so hard for Now I truly believe that me getting crazy sick back then was one of the best things that could have happened to me It led to me finally re owning the enjoyment of my everyday life Plus my business started rapidly growing as a result of me allocating my time more effectively and creating more value in less time It made me realize that much of the hustle I was doing was just me spinning my wheels on things that werent really making the boat go faster Now I know for sure that the best way to achieve better results is to master both the work and the relaxation To plan the life in such a way that your wealth health and relationships are in perfect balance Please dont waste your life thinking that theres some pride in being overstressed overworked and overwhelmed,Anxiety/Stress
Its horrifying that being sad has come to be treated as a mental disorderNow you have people in horrible circumstances that are being told the reason they feel terrible is because their brains do not work good And that they need therapy and medication to fix their disorder Which in reality is just sadness at how awful their lives areYou have parents who make their children have awful lives and then when the children become sad the parents go to the doctor and get a handy diagnosis and drugs and therapist for the emotional problems that they caused And they are told it is not your fault your childs brain chemistry does not work correctly And hundreds of thousands of people make careers profiting off this horrific scam Telling sad lonely people that the reason they feel bad is because they have a disease of the brain My life was ruined by the mental health industry There should be no treatment of social anxiety or depression as if they are curable diseases like cancer What an awful world and predatory people Mental health industry is criminal,Depression

Hey you all So here is the deal I have been depressed for about let us see here 16 years at least Not the most fun process honestly It took awhile to get things sorted out for a number of reasons Lately though things have been seeming to actually be not bad anymore thanks to a 3month period bupropion followed by its cessation I actually have hope for my future and I do not spend every other minute thinking about what a piece of trash I am in whatever aspect of life I am thinking about in any given momentThe problem is now I am faced with a lot of emotions that I do not really know how to process there is a fair bit of sadness at missing out on a childhood and young adulthood that a lot of people seem to get to enjoy there is definitely a lot of anger at people who either ignored me or went out or their way to bully or assault me And there is even a bunch of weird confusing feelings that were heavily muted during my long period of numbness like questioning my gender that are now asking that they be listening toThe thing is I am not really quite sure how to handle them it is like being depressed never really meant I could not feel things but rather that they were all saved up and now I am getting hit with them like a tourist in the surf off the coast of Maui I find myself going back and forth between moments of anger happiness sadness confusion and exhaustion That being the case does anyone have any suggestions for how to process and deal with such a chaotic mess Oh and before you suggest it such a mess is not related to a manic phase or anything like that I am strictly unipolar baby Assistance with a New Set of Circumstances Surfing the Chaotic Tides,Depression

Lately I have been feeling very listless and like an absolute failure in every department I am a survivor of child abuse and I thought after escaping that the remnants of my family would be okay and we would be fine and that was the last big battle I had to fight I went to college like I was told to It was fine but I got a useless degree German I got my masters in teaching but it has been impossible to find a district teaching job Student loan payments are coming due and I already barely squeak by on my meager charter school salary of 36k Sadly this is not all that is wrong I am fat and have struggled with bulimia and body dysmorphia Not to mention having a million acne scars all over my body No one has ever loved me more than a one night stand I am probably the ugliest person alive In the gay community I am the picture of repulsive I do not blame anyone but myself The ptsd nightmares never stop I am the only one in my family who is not with a long term partner I want kids so bad but I am getting too old I am 27 I do not want to become a parent when I am too old I have tried everything to lose weight and nothing works I have arthritis so working out is so hard plus I am so shy that I am mortified of people looking at me while exercisingEverything is going wrong I am so poor and fat and ugly that it just really feels like there is no point I have to take so much medicine to keep my mental health from crippling me and it makes me feel like I am nothing more than damaged goods I just feel like such a burden to everyone and everything and I really do just feel like it would be best if I spared everyone from dealing with my worthless self Because of my obesity I will probably die young anyway I just want to find a way to make it look accidental to spare my family a bit I am sorry this is long I do not know,Suicidal

Dad rejects and refuses to try and understand or help me get through the negative emotions and suicidal thoughts I feel He guilt trips me and makes me the bad guy all the time even if something is not my fault Hes recently guilted me into keeping a fulltime job and trying to go to college fulltime That means 5060 hours of my week will be for work and school I no longer have a social life besides my gf I no longer enjoy my hobbies and just existing in general is actually physically exhausting My mom died 5 years ago so I cannot talk with her about my issues and my stepmom does not seem to care much I also got diagnosed with T1 Diabetes 2 years ago and having a chronic illness also makes life physically and mentally painful So about 2 years ago my dad and I got in a 2 hour argument about how I was feeling mentally and he said You know what let us just not talk anymore At all I know you love me and I love you too but that does not mean we have to like each other Whenever we see each other well try to be friendly but other than that let us just avoid each other he legit said that after I told him I feel like he does not try to help me mentally or try to understand how I feel and why I feel that way He was ready to just kick me out of his life That tells me he does not actually give a crap about me as much as he says he does Just knowing that my only blood parent that I have left feels that way about me is just painful I have had enough of this life I have a plan to kill myself already I just need to get the courage to go through with it Thanks for reading Life is too much,Suicidal

I have fucked everything up and let it go on so long it is irreparable I can barely handle day to day life as it is I cannot even imagine trying to fix things on top of it there is absolutely nothing that brings me enough joy in this world to make up for all the stupid bullshit we have to put up with just to exist Nothing I do ever ends up making a difference Every attempt to improve myself has left me worse off than before I tried to go to college that just led to me getting bullied like a bad teen drama I worked so fucking hard and went so far out of my comfort zone and my professors did not give a shit None of them remember me I cannot get any references and I have not gotten a job in over 2 years of looking I just spent three years and 16000 in absolute miseryI tried to improve my relationship with my family But everything I do they see through a negative lense No matter what I do they manage to spin it so that I come out selfish spoiled and lazy I tried to improve my figure by working out but now I am just skinny in places I need fat fat in places I need to be skinny and have unfeminine muscle mass in random places And surprise surprise it did not shrink my massive ribcage or reduce my hipdips or help straighten my spine I tried hair removal now I have unsightly strawberry legs and the hair grows back funny I started moisturizing and wearing sunscreen but the damage is already done so it just leaves me looking like a greasy pig I tried taking birth control to help cope with my period but it made it worse And when I went off it my boobs shrunk I was already barely an A cup And losing what little volume I had in the front just accentuates my kyphosis I have always been ugly but I look so much worse you would think I would let myself go rather than finally start taking care of myself I am embarrassed to run into people I used to know And it is only going to get worse with age I am so fucking anxious about ageing Knowing how much uglier I have steadily become over just the past 5 years I cannot imagine what 40 more will doI cannot be happy living alone I have tried but it is just too easy to spiral when there is no one to distract you And you feel so isolated I know if I ever committed to living alone I would just give up completely I will not get any sleep then I will be too anxious and apathetic to go to leave the house so I will just lie in bed and stare at my phone while leaving the house gets harder and harder and I will end up starving to death But a relationship is not an attainable goal for me Straight men hate my guts They pointedly ignore me at best Even if someone is desperate enough to give me a shot they will never like me I am too repulsive and awkward and cringey and annoying I have no prospects in life I am pretty much just bumming around my parents house til they get sick of me and kick me out I have no prospects for a career relationship independence friendship a happy life Everything is too hard and complicated and I have too many regrets I am just not cut out for life It feels too late for everything,Suicidal

I initially wanted to pull an allnighter to get some stuff done After awhile I could not focus on anything I started ruminating on the past and started thinking about how unfulfilling life is I can never get over the fact that I am not good for anything anymoreI few hours later I feel like my existence is a waste and that things will never get better I started looking for my boyfriends gun as that would do the job best Eventually I get tired and sit back down It does not help that I cannot sleepI know a handful of people care a little about me and I would not want to burden anyone with my corpse I feel like my best option is to plan out a way to disappear to make things easier for themI did not start having these thoughts until it got really late I do not understand and I do not know what to do Does this happen to you Does insomnia make you spiral or does spiraling give you insomnia,Depression

Is anyone elses anxiety fueling your depression because nothing seems to work Everyone says try drinking more water Doesnt work Try changing your diet Doesnt work Deep breathing exercises Doesnt work Try exercising Kinda works but it comes back shortly after my workout LTheanine Heard great things about it Makes my anxiety worse Oh what about Magnesium Glycinate Makes my anxiety worse The only thing that helps me personally other than prescription drugs which I am trying to stay away from is hiking in nature on a sunny day But even then as soon as I leave it comes back I know everyones symptoms are different but shortness of breath is the main symptom I experience Even saying a sentence these days I feel out of breathe I wish I can destroy the parts of my brain that trigger anxiety every second Im alive,Anxiety/Stress

I am 17 and I have been depressed for almost as long as I can really remember My last truly happy memory was probably when I was 5 and its laughably simple just laying between my parents in bed as the weather played on an old TV A couple years ago my last grandpa died and I felt nothing at all It made me feel gross that I did notThis year I told my doctor I was depressed and wanted to die They gave me a therapist and medication I have only ever lied to my therapist since I have told my doctor all medications I have taken feel like placebos and do absolutely nothing except give me erectile disfunction this is the only true thing I have said In the last few months things have really gotten worse My only really close friend that I would have done anything for just stopped wanting to hangout I have been planning on bringing him backpacking and rowing and every single time despite expressing interest pulls out at the last second and it really hurts me because I love them and want to do things Then my boyfriend the only person I have genuinely felt was the one for me just stopped talking to me never officially breaking up but every time I try to talk to him he either goes quiet or gets irritable It hurts so much because I love him so much and I genuinely wanted to spend the rest of my life with him and he had expressed that he felt similarly And as of a month ago I have not a single friend I have not really talked to anyone in a long whileThen this week my grandma died and again I felt nothing despite having seen her the most out of my grandparents I feel like I am a selfish monster to not feel anything when my family dies but be so torn up when everyone else leaves I just feel like I do not belong here I just want to reset it all I have planned on killing myself before and just could not go though with it that feeling of wanting to die never left I just cannot do it myself I just wish Id die in some accident or something Ill never be normal I cannot even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to rip my face off I cannot even think without wanting to tear my brain out because of shear regret that I cannot just have a second chance I hate myself and I do not even know why I Just want to close my eyes and never wake up I do not have anywhere else to go and I just need someone to talk to,Suicidal
Talking to my mom today and she says I do not drink because when you were little I had to watch you which I just silently agreed to when in my head I am thinking it would have probably been better for you to just be drunk rather than what you actually did you dumb bitch because what she used to do is leave 34 year old me basically alone in the house because on a regular basis she would lock her bedroom door and take long naps What kind of irresponsible and neglectful parent does that shit And she thinks I am too stupid too remember that Like I could have drank liquor and bleach or burned the damn house down And yeah let us not forget the time my mom violently beat down the door in a fit of rage where my dad had to take me and we had to hide in the closet and the police had to show up Which my dad did not press charges which would have in the long run prevented her from getting custody over me preventing mountains of more abuse I do not resent my father for that though Hes just too forgiving like that there is other things my mother did that I was too young to remember in which the only person with guts enough to tell m is my grandpa who is one of the few reasons I have not offed myself yet Every time I was slapped punched kicked even slammed into the wall Every time I was verbally abused every time I was neglected Child abuse is something that becomes imbedded into you It forever changes you I have some form of ptsd one of the therapists told me I remember one instance my mother tried to kick me This time I had enough I grabbed her leg mid kick immediately her expression changed I twisted it she said stop almost crying I was livid almost overtaken with the thought of revenge I asked her in a deep angry tone do you want me throw your sorry ass on the floor I realized in a moment of clarity that Id probably be locked in a jail cell if I did that I stopped what I was doing Felt guilt Was I wrong Was I right Ill never know Just as Ill never know who I would have been without a psychotic abusive parent Abuse,Suicidal

I am so damn exhausted of my mind screwing everything up I am about to turn 30 in a few weeks and although I have been fortunate enough to have had many women interested in me throughout the years I just cannot seem to hold a stable relationship for longer than a few months When I was younger it was not a huge deal but now that I am getting older I am beginning to feel I may never be able to develop a longlasting meaningful romantic connection with anyone and it makes me feel so deeply aloneThe thing is I am able to clearly see how it is me pushing my partners away Once the initial excitement wears off I go back to being aloof insecure and selfcentered and I can sense my masculine essence eroding I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off I do not blame them I do not want them to carry any of my burdens I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better But with each passing relationship I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident fun version of me is kind of a parttime dealOn top of it all I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers I am rapidly losing my hair about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray I have bad eye bags and dark circles and although I have tried I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out but the same thing happenedMy last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her But somehow just a week later the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest The thing is I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connectionsI know I need to develop selflove and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life The only thing I am truly passionate about is music and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires Besides that I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry two semesters left but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school and the job prospects with a BS in that field look bleakAre there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles If so how did you manage I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further Thank you for reading Dating as a Man with Depression,Depression

I am currently on 100mg of Zoloft I started reducing by 5 about 2 weeks ago because I would like to slowly get off of it I have been on Zoloft for one year switched different medications in the past but these past 3 years have been extremely difficult I have always gone through waves of severe depression and have always been able to get myself out it but nothing is working anymore I just feel so apathetic and down every single day I am eating good quit smoking working out forcing myself into social situations and doing everything I can do keep a healthy mind My friends know me as the life of the party I am extremely extroverted and it is a performance every time I am around them I am an actor so nobody knows anything is wrong and I can hide it very well After 30 minutes or an hour of socializing my energy is completely depleted now which was never the case in the past I feel so numb and I think getting off this drug will be absolute hell for me At least when I am on Zoloft I do not have extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts just apathy and anhedonia I do not know if I am making the right decision by making these reductions Has anyone switched to another medication that helped My doctor took me off Zoloft in the past which I was on for 8 years and weaned way too quickly He had me switch to Luvox and it literally almost put me in a mental hospital I went back on Zoloft and the sducidal ideation stopped but the apathy and anhedonia is bad right now I really cannot beat this and I am scared for my future I have zero motivation lost all my passions for everything I used to love Has anyone had luck on something else I am scared to come off of this drug again I cannot beat it anymore,Depression

Are You an Introvert with Anxiety Anxiety That emotion warning us something threatening is just about to happen Lifesaving when we are genuinely threatened damaging when we become constantly anxious anxiety is tiring it is meant to be We are only meant to be anxious for very short periods When prolonged it isnt just tiring it is exhausting Sound familiar Introverts Those of us who prefer calm situations and environments We prefer to recharge on our own We often enjoy losing ourselves in our own thoughts We tend to have small closeknit social lives it doesnt mean were antisocial Not all introverts experience anxiety and you dont have to be an introvert to struggle with it Many introverts deal with anxiety though so this is quite common Here are the key signs youre an introvert with anxiety Youre more prepared than most others because youve already thought through the worstcase scenarios You have a tendency to overthink things and pay too much attention to your negative selftalk You feel you always have to be doing something being busy which is often different from being effective may be a means of trying to cope with the anxiety You tend to prefer routines to novel situations While this can be fine for periods boredom and unexpected issues arising can easily throw you in to a spin Youre often nervous without showing it many become very effective at masking their emotions as a defence mechanism You are more likely to perceive situations as being more dangerous than they really are anxiety primes us for the fight flight freeze response making us more likely to overreact to a lowrisk situation You have tendencies towards perfectionism This is often allied to beliefs such as I need to please everyone I need everyone to like me to be a worthy person Nervousness can throw your chatter in to overdrive while you normally only speak when you have something significant to say and youre normally sure of your facts before speaking nerves can have you chattering away in an attempt to overcompensate You often have trouble sleeping either getting to sleep atall waking through the night or waking way too early Being an introvert with anxiety can be hard Thankfully there is help at hand Anxiety in its many guises is one of the most common issues Solution Focused Hypnotherapy therapists helps people with Ask yourself What have I learned from this article that I will adopt today as my own What is the one thing that has grabbed me and what will I do about it NOW,Anxiety/Stress

was I put here Why this body Why this life What in the FUCK did I do in my past life or whatever to deserve this Seriously I want to know Was I like Hitler or somethingampx200BYou may ask yourself he cannot be that bad right And you would be wrongampx200BI will give you a brief overview immediate victim of favoritism within the first 3 years of life I mean BLATANT favoritism parents divorced within those 3 years parents stole me from each other back and forth until Social Services stepped in first foster home gave me a short glimpse of what it was like to be cared for in the first time of my 8 years of life ended up being taken out of that home after about 6 months and put into a new one new foster mother beats me regularly sexually abused me frequently and to top it off keeps me locked up in a basement room with no windows no clocks no way to tell time Leaving me in there for days at a time This was frequently done over a 5 year period of my life after 5 years had passed my father got custody of me only to treat me like a ghost He only got me back for the SSI check Other than that I did not exist to him pretty much in school I was teased a lot because I was constantly in sweats I did not have any real clothing other than that and laundry was not done on any regular basis Their laundry was mine was not already extremely socially isolated things progressively got worse up to the point of someone physically bullying me and eventually I snapped and put him in the hospital Made me realize what a monster I was during the last couple years of high school I found my high school sweetheart We were together for 7 years We made a son together he is currently 17 turning 18 later this year social services got involved in my life again claiming we had failed to get our son his shots which we had to reschedule because her grandmother had passed on the day before the scheduled shots So there goes a year and a half of fighting the incessant demands of social services they get into her head Tell her she does not need me She leaves me takes me to court for 100 custody At that point I did not think I could possibly be more broken I did not have a choice so I just gave up and within 2 months she had taken my son to another state to pursue some internet boyfriend she met on some backwards art site D something or another a couple years pass and I decide to try again with someone new Started off strong but there were a ton of issues and a lot of damage left behind from my past relationship I could never trust her still she got pregnant on our second time so she had not gotten a chance to see the extent of the damage in me I wish I could have been able to tell her to just run run away from me I suppose in some way I did just not in so many words towards the end our son was delivered as a stillborn His umbilical cord had wrapped around his neck killing him days before he was due Just a few days we split ways after this I took the loss personally as though it was Gods way of punishing me for being the monster I was Got super suicidal and tried dozens of times to end myself All failed obviously a few more years passed after and I was still stuck on this notion that I wanted a family So naturally I found a new relationship and moved clear across the country just to be with her while we were in person together things were amazing It was like gravity we could not stay away from each other But when the time came to part ways that is when things got ugly fast still we managed to make it last for nearly 5 years and she bore me another son I wanted to be there so badly and she knew I did We had talked about several times I got to see my son ONCE before she decided she was going to keep him from me Even despite the fact she knew I was going to be a good father First her it was just easier to not have to fight her grandparents who she lived with So that is what she did He was born nearly 7 years ago and I have not seen him since the day he was born after two years of fighting with her to just be a family with me I finally broke in the worst way I have ever broken in my life I just gave up She was not going to change her mind ever So I walked away more suicide attempts and a few months later I decided a drastic change was needed inside me So that is what I did I pursued self actualization and personal development and started to try to deal with all thus trauma I had experienced in this life something clicked inside like a burner just turned on and suddenly I started thinking differently I became different than who I was before The original owner of this vessel was gone and I was born I was ready to accept that I would never have my own family but I was not ready to give up on love so I went and found a new relationship This one was actually pretty good I did not accuse her of cheating ever in our entire relationship I gave her room to do her own stuff and encouraged her to take time with her son her friends her family I was being a good partner for once in my life and I was open to her open to the idea this could last it honestly felt like it was my forever home I let myself actually believe in that as you may suspect things eventually fell apart She pulled away from me stopped so much as even touching me and I tried to talk with her communicate what was going on to no avail The day we broke up she had gone away for 5 days saying she was babysitting her sisterinlaws dog Well I found out that that whole story was a lie just from a Facebook post of her sisterinlaw at home with her two children getting ready for the weekend in the end she said it was because I was too sensitive and too difficult to love Those words still stick with me almost 2 years later now at this point I am completely lost about what I want anymore I want to have that relationship that lasts but I am not sure I can trust myself to actually even try again So what else is there for me I could never have my family cannot even have a secure relationship even when I have worked so hard to be acceptable and lovable I cannot help but feel like I am just wasting time wasting my therapists time all in some delusion that I will ever be worthy of loveampx200Bthat is just a chunk of my iceberg The super short short version I suppose that is why it is so hard for me to believe that anyone could even comprehend the things I have been through The bottom is not where you think it is There are places in the mind much darker much deeper than you may ever know End all Be all,Depression

Warning this is long I am basically describing all my problems I am 23 I am supposed to have finished my first year at this really good law school I have told everyone that I am Instead I have actually been a graduate student with my masters in legal science at a less reputed college near me while actually applying now I have lied to everyone I left my hometown to go to law school I moved into an apartment with my high schoolcollege bestie She works a LOT as an engineer Moving in with her was a great idea I do not regret it and I still love her she is a good roommate but honestly she just talks a LOT about herself and her life I feel like she never asks me I am also very good at deflecting but I wish she would push a little harder to ask how I am So I tend to avoid her and chill in my room a lot I also need time to relax I also smoke weed almost every day and lie about it I have a vaping problem that is so hard to quit but I am trying I lost my gramps earlier this year and its been difficult because he was my favorite man on this planetI was diagnosed with ADHD and generalized anxiety disorder bordering depression Was also prescribed medication I never kept up with I was going to my psychiatrist then she moved to a different clinic that did not take my insurance Its been like 6 months since and I still have not gone to another here is the issue that I think triggered me to become the asshole My cousin had this graduation extravaganza party I did a lot I worked a lot I fucking cleaned up vomit and managed t o send 30 teenagers home after 1am and ubers were closed I worked my ass off and just never felt appreciated through the whole moment Even worse I feel like I annoyed everyone So it triggered me real bad and I pushed away everyone Now I am stuck with no one I can talk to I have some really good friends I just completely stopped talking to By the time I realized Id pushed everyone away and stopped talking I could not figure out how to respond and they all STILL to this day have been trying to get me to talk to them But a group of friends two of whom I stopped talking to and the rest people I was t close with and I had planned a trip months ago The hotel reservation was under my name and I had a discount If I did not go they would not be able to stay there So I went felt like everyone hated me the whole trip The last day was super bad and I cried many times secretly through the day in the bathrooms lmao Then I got super wasted and cried for hours in front of 3 of them No one cared to really talk to me because we had a 9 hour drive that day So right before that trip I was ready to apologize to all my friends Then the trip happened and I no longer really want to talk to anyone I am not suicidal I just do not want to live The only reason I am still on this planet is my mom I could never kill myself because I cannot fail her But I imagine myself dying or getting cancer all the time I do not want to do anything I have lost passion is everything I know I am for real depressed I lie about EVERYTHING because I do not want anyone to think negatively about me bc I already have severe body image issues and I cannot stand to let others thinks there is more wrong with me besides the fact that I am clinically obese I push everything off I am pretty sure I have a rotting tooth that could probably get infected and kill me at any time but I have not gone to the dentist because I do not have the energy and now I am scared and also I do not want to I need to know if I am an asshole to my friends but also advice on how to get out of this rut In the last 3 days I have not been smoking I have not been vaping I go to coffee shops and work super hard on my applications also helps that I have some left over ADHD meds I finally started to feel some hope and light My diet is good I no longer binge eat like I used to everyday I also go the gym like 3 times a week Something feels different this time but I need any and all advice on how to forward with all my problems Loser and asshole and sad,Suicidal

I mean yes and no depending on the circumstances Say if you are stressed about life and have some sort of hope left yes but for people who are too far gone extremely depressed then no and usually just makes you more depressed or suicidal I rang a crisis line a few days ago and they put me on hold so I just overdosed and was taken to hospital Why put people who are depressed on hold Very strange Oh well that is what its like in my country if you are want help from a help line Help lines do not really help do they,Suicidal
Death is easy I do not know where I came up with this philosophy but I did It mainly stems from the belief that at any point in life one can escape to any point in human existence Life has only ever been a reassurance that this is fact The only thing one cannot overcome is timeage and this is limited I am highly suicidal But any time I truly contemplate it I consider my options I would much rather run away and dig wells for people struggling to live without clean water than to eat a bullet I could go kamikaze on the homeless population and solve one of societys problems from within fucked up but falls within human experience I could be selfish and quit on family and throw my life into helping any one of hundreds of suffering communities Fuck I could set out to end the war on drugs by becoming the biggest drug supplier in the world and then destroying the organization from within If you are contemplating suicide consider how to best spend your life it could take 20 or 80 years to accomplish what you want but make sure yours is a life well spent In all of human experience there is ALL human experience,Suicidal

I have been struggling with depression for more than half of my life For more than half of that time I have not had any truly supporting friends who will be there when things are rough I spent the past many years struggling to figure out if this is me or if its the people around me and I cannot figure it out So I am wondering do you have friends who support you through the good and the bad What does this support look like Will they listen to your feelings and struggles Do you have friends who will check in once in a while to see how you are doingAre these things too much to hope for in a friend Is depression really just an isolated journey where I can expect to have no close friendsrelationships until I find a way out of depression Do you have supporting friends,Depression

Am I choosing the right mindeset I wonder is it my stress time management or myself as a person in general that is blocking myself from doing the best I can Or is it my anxiety and overthinking getting to me I am a F14 in my freshman year of high school currently going through a roller coaster of thoughts and emotions Im trying really hard managing between piano soccer and my grades with school I love everything equally well maybe except school but in the end my grades are my priority over piano or soccer I know that piano and soccer may benefit me throughout high school but grades are more important But that doesnt mean Im going to give up on neither one But here I am with a B 845 in my history class and I need to get it to an A 901 by the end of my school final which is in about 2 months Well Ill need an A at least so I could take AP Euro in my sophomore year and its only available in my sophomore year as well AP Euro is definitely not a necessity for my next year in high school but itll benefit me a lot and as my school is very tough and competitive I want to achieve my goal and do it My teacher is crazy strict being 87 years old he has his more olderfashioned and more understandable ways of grading So I stress trying to fit into his perfect standards but at the end of the day I keep telling myself In the future there will always be people that will be wanting a perfect requirement that fits them I will need to be able to be adjusting to those specific requirements for the future to benefit myself and my ideal career future and more Ive never gotten a B or a grade range in the B section B B or B throughout middle school and my first semester of high school until now Is it the stress thats piling on me after all these hard schoolwork Im not managing well or enough with my time that I have My sleep schedule is actually horrid I usually sleep at 24AM waking up at 6AM with soccer practice 34 times a week usually I skip at least 1 day a week since its a little too much and 2 lessons of piano a week Also including the clubs Ive decided to join Mock Trials which is now coming to an end with competitions Volunteering which I guess I could choose which days to help out but The homework The load at my school is actually crazy about 23 assignments new each period which is every day so in a week total about 3040 assignments which is quite a buttload Its due either the following days or sometimes a miracle as it is itll be due next week But then again theres at least 12 tests a week which I need to study a lot for Oh of course theres also the projects and essays lets add about 1 for every other week Should I take a break from piano or soccer and put my grades at my priority instead I think I can be able to take my grade 845 up to a 901 at least which is 6 of a percentage raise that Ill need to be okay Telling my friends this all I get in response is the same Itll be okay All I wish these days is someone to tell me more than itll be okay Im still new to the environment of high school and figuring out what fits for me and what doesnt fit for me Encouragement something I havent heard in awhile is what I hope boosts me Thanks for reading this far TLDR Not having the most decent grade in history class 845 wanting to take AP Euro next year for my class I need at least a 901 for my requirement to join the class Struggling with the management of piano and soccer as well for my extracurricular activities as well as school clubs should I take a break from something I need to put my grades before other stuff including the fact to not freak out with studying and use time well Also wish someone could tell me Im able to do it and they have confidence in me Thanks again,Anxiety/Stress

One hell of a year Hi just discovered this subreddit and wanted to sort of share my experience with this For the last 7 months or so I was totally convinced I had some sort of cancer It all started when noticed a swollen lymph node on the side of my neck The lymph node had been swollen for about 2 years and i never thought anything of it until i went to ol Dr Google Fast forward countless doctors appointments a spur of the moment ER visit CT Scans and an eventual biopsy and it turns out I dont have any life threatening conditions I got so obsessed with cancer that I started going to dermatology clinics because I was convinced that some of my moles looked suspicious of course they were fine I mean I worked outside a lot without sunscreen and a permanently swollen lymph node is unusual so I guess I was right to be somewhat concerned However I really blew it all out of proportion for a long time and despite all evidence pointing to being healthy I cannot shake this sense of impending doom that Ive had for the last 7 months Its honestly making it hard to move on with my life and enjoy things Anyone else have issues like this How do you deal with it,Anxiety/Stress
it is too long for me now Everything just gets worse and worse there is nothing in this world i know but pain sadness and tears I just need someone that loves me how I am someone that does not only criticizes me or says how bad I am and everytime I find a person like this I think I get friend zoned instantly I mean that does not mean that is bad but I want a person that lays beside me in my bed and that I can hold tightly and feel safe with And why can I give so many people good advises but I can help myselft even a little bit I think I am just too broken for everything A long time I could hide my sadness but now it is hard to not break down in tears every single second I am awake and that is just annoying And even my friends I can talk about everything I do not think they want to hear me more crying about myself so that is why I just stopped talking about my feelings lately One example is I met this girl only around 2 months ago and I think i could talk with her about everything that bothers me but lately I feel like everytime I say to her that I am sad she just gets annoyed by this and this really breaks my heart because I really do not want to lose her I already lost so many people in my life another one would break me completely I really do not know what I am going to do the next years I am so afraid that I am doing something really bad to me because I do not want to disappoint my parents or my friends that I am so weak I have never showed any of my weaknesses to anyone but I do not wana do this anymore I do not want to fake anything about me I think life and everything around it is just a cruel and depressing place I hate it to be single I just want to be loved but I really do not think that anyone ever could really love me and this just fcks me up There is no day in like 2 years now where I do not cry me to sleep And on top of everything in the last months everything around me changed and that to fast I had to let go of long friends I had to realize a close friend of mine is in deep depressions and so much more and I just cannot process all of it I tried talking to that girl I mentioned before but she acts completely different than at the first days I talked to her She was like she did not tried to give a good advice or to comfort me she just like said to me that I cannot change it and I should not bother about it which is not really helpful I mean I am not mad at her I am just confused and I am too shy to ask her why she is acting so different I am just such a weak person like I am not even trying anymore to be strong or sth because it does not matter I can smile how long i want I public it does not will change anything ever I do not want to kill myself but at the same time I do not want to love anymore I just want to not exist anymore and no one on this entire planet ever remembers me or even knows that I existed Everytime this girl texts me I can smile and even when it is only for a few seconds in this few second I am truly happy and I do not think she knows that but she probably does not like me the way I like her and that is the reason I do not want to confess my feelings to her because I know this will just end up in she not texting me or not answering my messages and I think then I am done with everything This might sounds stupid I know but she is the first girl I met ever to just like me how I am and not to look a certain way and this feeling is just awesome I felt like there was some hope for me And I said to myself before I was texting so much with her that I am not getting into a state like I am but I just could not resist I could not belive how perfect she is and that brought me to the point where I maybe cannot live without her and that is even more terrifying because I know on some day I will fuck everything up and Ill completely lose her I could type so much more but idk I think that was long enough Oh btw I am 17 and I know this just could be phase but like I said I cannot take this anymore and I do not know what to do now If you are read this till here i want to thank you I love it to talk about my feelings and this place is probably the best for itAnd yes that was all know thx and bye I think I am done with everything,Suicidal
Ive had such an awful month for my HA lol First I was worried about my gallbladder because at the beginning of the month I was experiencing some nausea acid reflux and other pains that seem to be associated with having gallstones Thankfully my ultrasound looked normal so I wasnt as worried anymore Then I was dealing with an upper respiratory infection and my symptoms lingered for so long that I thought I had strepwhich thankfully I didnt But Ive been experiencing so many more stomach pains these past few weeks and last night I was awake for what felt like the worst acid reflux Ive ever had Im still feeling it today I dont know if its GERD an ulcer or could even be side effects from the birth control Im using but of course I think its a million different horrible issues,Anxiety/Stress

Apologies in advance if this post is long Ill try to have all the detail in as few words as I canQuick background I am about to be a junior in college good home life a lot of friends very intelligent struggles with anxiety but never anything too extremeIn September of 2020 I suffered a head injury playing pickup football with some friends It did not feel serious at all and I was back in the game a few minutes later like nothing had happened The symptoms did not kick in for about 10 daysIn hindsight it was probably a mild concussion and nothing too major However I had no idea what I was dealing with so I treated it probably exactly how you should not treat it I worried about it constantly and pushed myself with school partying etc there is not a lot of wiggle room when it comes to slowing down in the college life so I just continued to try to push on which ended up being a bad idea I was up and down with symptoms for about 67 weeks during this timeIn late November I suddenly crashed and everything went to shit again All of the sudden in the course of a day I became totally dissociated and my brain fog increased tremendously I thought it was nothing more than a symptom flair at first but eight months later I still deal with these symptoms 247 and they have destroyed my lifeI have done everything seen all the doctors I thought would help and nothing has given me any relief I have been constantly dissociated since that time and my brain functions at a fraction of the capacity it used to It makes life fucking terrible to live I can still try and do things I did before but I can never enjoy anything due to the way I constantly feel My motivation is pretty much gone Driving feels like a life risking activity every time I do it School was next to impossible last semester and I am no better for this one coming upThe silver lining is that I think the problem here is that all the worry and anxiety has been trapped in my brain and the trauma surrounding the worrying is the issue rather than the injury itself I was not officially diagnosed with depression but one doctor thought that is what could be prolonging my issues Even with this knowledge I cannot find any relief whatsoever I struggle to tell people this first because its very personal second because I struggle to share my feelings and third because I have always been a guy to light up the room and now I have to act because I do not want to bring peoples moods down when they are around me The people in my life know I am suffering from this but nobody knows the suffering I deal with mentally on a daily basis I am just very hopeless right now I wanted to get this off my chest anonymously,Depression

Freedom is an illusion Money buys an illusion of freedom To me I define freedom doing whatever you want without suffering non of the consequencesbut the way this system has been designed is that there is one group controlling the otherWhatever social group you associate yourself with If you do find freedom eventually religion will find a way to steal it by breaking the law so they can run a story on you or sending someone from the darkweb to steal your hard earned money so the big media companies can run a story on you on how deeply flawed you are and how perfect they areWomen control the world and the internet including the darkweb and deep web and I2P and the entire financial marketYou are a slave so get used to it because women are crazy and men are stupid why you have no freedom,Depression

I am at my wits end I grew up in a broken home parents who physically fought and abused drugs and alcohol I was abandoned by my parents as a teenager and had to look after myself and meet my physical needs from the age of 13 I had no one to give me love and emotional support for that I turned to unhealthy habits I grew up hanging out with a bad crowd and we were taken advantage of by an adult we should have trusted I have made terrible decisions about people I let into my life because I was not shown what a healthy relationship was I have witnessed my best friend drown I have lost countless friends and family members before I even turned 20 Yet somehow I climbed out of these dark holes I am nearly thirty and still learning how to take care of myself adult things that no one showed me I studied at someone of the top universities in my field have experience careerwise so am able to get a job to feed myself and put a roof over my head I have travelled extensively and currently live abroad my friends often express their envy of my life But the thing is I am miserable I am tired of it all I want the memories to leave I want the pain to stop I have been to therapy but the memories do not go they are still there and I do not want them anymore I figure I have two options to end it all and forget or pack my backs live a life free from any worry these options feel like two sides of the same coin for me Because if I end it all I might as well ignore the allconsuming anxiety that takes over my life I am so over it I just wish I had a better start in life instead of continually being dragged down by my blackenheart Life has been hard and I want to forget it,Suicidal

Is this my rock bottom My life has been flipped upside down within the past 48 hours I have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a child But never have I felt more alone than I do now My fianc is leaving and taking our animals Were selling our house I cannot go to family I feel like I cannot go to my friends My life was rebuilt and just when I reached a point where I did not curse out the person I saw in the mirror every morning it ends Just to now be so alone and with no purpose or direction I have got drafts of letters to send to family if it comes to that But I cannot even do that I am scared and I have nobody to even talk to I do not know why I am posting this on Reddit I am not expecting empathetic responses But my notes on my phone just are not doing anything for me I guess this is just an outlet Not sure where else to go,Depression

I am feeling a lot of existential dread at the fact I am almost 30 and have achieved nothing worthy of notice I have suffered depression and anxiety since I was 18 years old and I have always managed to overcome it until the past 2 years I am stuck in a house I despise to the point where I live in my bedroom cos it is my only safe area and cannot afford to repair or move because I only earn 7k a year as a cleaner I have applied for endless jobs to try and improve giving up on finding jobs relating to my degree illustration and design because the Northeast of England just does not have those kinds of opportunities I work freelance and have tried running an Etsy selling merchandise but have been on a 2 year hiatus because I am slowly losing the will to see whyI have applied for so many jobs and constantly get rejections my manager was kind enough to offer me receptionist shifts now and then But even with that experience I am still not good enough I recently dabbled in OF not for money related reasons but for some kind of selflove and confidence boost I stopped because it felt pointless even when earning a little I also stream occasionally for fun but I have even lost enjoyment from that I am at a point where I just no longer want to exist I have been in bed for days and feel a burden to my partner who has been ever so kind to me I feel like I do not deserve his help in all honestly I tried ringing my doctor about some therapy I was referred again to a UK company called Talking Changes which were useless to me in the past When I told my doctor this he just said well I cannot do anything else so I never asked for help since that was also 2 years agoI tried talking to my parents about how I feel and as I broke down crying I was snapped at for being upset as it does not help anything and it is no use crying I just ended up driving home whilst crying my eyes out That was the last time I got out of bed 4 days ago I am not drinking anything I am not eating I just want to slowly shut down because I see no end to this persistent hell I never wanted a big fancy life all I wanted was to be happy and content to feel like I was worth at least something All of my friends are making big achievements getting big promotions buying nice houses even my bullies are achieving more And I am just a loser like I always was Just basic bitch me I know if I could at least afford to move house it would be a start and I would feel comfortable But it is like the universe is fighting against everything I do I just do not know what to do anymore I am stuck and I want it to stop,Suicidal

Health Anxiety is ruining my life So it all started getting worse when about three weeks ago I accidentally got hit in the forehead with a soft car seat I wasnt knocked out or anything A amp E said I had no serious injuries no bruise etc My Health Anxietys like Well how do you know youre fine you should see a doctor again so that nothing new has come up I go to the doctor I phone two different doctors and they tell me I dont have any signs of a serious head injury I end up freaking out a few days later because of persistent headaches and feeling spaced out so I go to the A amp E again a different doctor gives me a neurological examination and tells me I dont have any serious injuries and should be more concerned about my anxiety Then out of nowhere one of my relatives has a heart attack and is in hospital hes fine and well now and I start to worry A few days after visiting him Im at my boyfriends house and lying in bed Im getting these headaches that have lasted about a week now as well as a sudden pain in my arm and chest and become totally convinced that Im having a heart attack or a stroke It doesnt help that I was starving myself because I was so stressed out I had lost half a stone in the space of a week I thought that I was dying because I hadnt eaten and was having heart problems because of this So now my HA brain thinks Ive had a stroke twice without noticing or being diagnosed and that I have a damaged brain and that I also might have a brain tumour Ive not been able to smell or taste things as well since I got a minor bump on the forehead but its quite possibly the case that my anxiety is convincing me I have these symptoms so Ive remained in this constant heightened state of numbness because of my anxiety believing that I have some sort of serious condition I was even at an audiologist because I believed that a visit to the cinema had permanently damaged my hearing everything was fine and he said I had no hearing damage I go to the doctor again because of my severe anxiety she tells me that all of my symptoms headaches ringing in ears loss of sense of smell are being caused by my anxiety She prescribes me with propranolol naturally I look up the side effects and become terrified to take the medication Just today I started getting a headache and was convinced I was taking a stroke again Ive became kind of emotionally numb now because Im constantly ruminating about what could be wrong with me healthwise I cant even enjoy things anymore because my HA goes Well maybe you cant enjoy that or feel much emotions or think about that the same way as you did before because you have brain damage caused by an undiagnosed TBI or a stroke I cant pay attention to things It doesnt matter what the doctors say after a few hours Im always convinced that theyre wrong and that theres a serious problem with my brain and they havent been able to find it yet Im so sick of this Can anyone else relate How do you convince yourself that theres nothing seriously wrong with you,Anxiety/Stress

For anyone struggling with fairly severe anxiety episodes I highly recommend DBT distress tolerance skills I recently started DBT after anxiety and depression became nearly unbearable for me and the specific distress tolerance skills and suggestions like hundreds of ideas about specific activities to do when feeling any kind of way has been the most life changing thing Ive learned I know DBT is expensive and inaccessible to a lot of people but here is a linkhttpsstatic1squarespacecomstatic577d2ce937c58194f7d39816t60c7e92fa3583448b8c6fa191623714139969dbtskillstraininghandoutsandworksheetslinehanmarshasrgpdf to the PDF my group uses The distress tolerance section has a plethora of information and strategies to combat anxiety and low moods and I highly suggest just taking a look in case anything jumps out at you My personal favorite is the TIP acronym cold temperatures like a cold shower or ice pack on your face intense exercise for a brief period of time like jumping jacks for one minute paced breathing or breath work sometimes even fast paced breaths for thirty counts then holding as long as you can all of which help trigger a system response that physically changes your state Or very sour candy that distracts your brain for a second to snap out of it Basically a bunch of tangible ideas to try out during a moment of panic Just thought Id share if anyone is looking for ideas Love you all lt3,Anxiety/Stress

I do not understand how anyone can say that life is a gift Like holy shit moron did you actually ever stopped for a second to take a look at how we are all living So hey let me just enumerate some reasons why life really sucks First of all most of your free time does not actually belong to you you are born in this shitass world and then adults just throw you against your will in elementary school and then high school just so the teachers there can brainwash you in other words transform you into a submitted and obedient wageslave while you are young so that you are ready to get into the workforce later on once you are 18 And well eventually you can also keep up the brainwashing even further if that is pleasing you in universityAnd hey i just forgot a detail if you dare display any difference from the other kids no matter how small and insignificant it is you might aswell get bullied and beaten on early on in life are not that a great thing And then once you become an adult yourself you are going to live your life with all the accumulated trauma during childhood and adolescence if you were unlucky enough to endure any of it Now you will get to enjoy the magnificent modern capitalist society and lifestyle that the sociopathspsychopaths at the top are forcing us to live in You will now waste your time at a job and a company you do not give a shit about for at least 8 hours a day 5 days a week for 45 years until you are too old to work anymore and then you are going to slowly rot away at a retirement home because you do not have any energy left to do anything you actually enjoyAnd of course if you dare display any symptoms of anxiety or depression during your life which quite honestly seems like a PERFECTLY reasonable way for anybody to react in the face of this boring DySTopIa we are living in at best people are going to tell you to go and see a psychiatristtherapist because of course the average NEUROFUCKINGTYPICAL person is actually perfectly welladapted to this garbagetier system and actually SOMEHOW never really suffered from itOr if you are unlucky enough people are going to call you crazy lazy ungrateful and what other adjectives to describe you are shitty behavior I mean wow you are such an ungrateful piece of shit dude you should be proud that the CEO psychopaths at the top are giving us the opportunity to slave our time and our lives away for their company I swear to fucking god there is not a single second minute or hour that I am not spending on this fucking earth wishing to kill myself and most of all that i was never born in the first place because if i knew that i would be living in this shitty capitalistic system it would have been way better and less painful if someone took a fucking axe and just sliced me inside my mothers bellyEveryhing in this fucking life sucks from my point of view Our way of living sucks people suck hell even i suck for being this fucking depressed everyday I am so fucking tired of it Nobody is going to be able to fix me ever again I am too fucking broken and it is too fucking late for it because I am a 27 year old loser who never really integrated properly in this shithole never had a girlfriend never had friends only thing i have is a fucking job i hate and my parents that i also fucking hate because they do not understand any of this shit when I am talking to them about this Great so the only options left for me is to either suicide or talk to a therapist what a great way to be living life hey I am legit not having a good time in this fucking life,Depression

Trigger warning Im 17 I have MS and Im worried I also have colon cancer Its been quite the rough year and Ill admit my HA wasnt as bad as it was after my family got the results from my first MRI test Sure I googled symptoms all the time especially because one of my enflamed lesions was causing me chronic nausea for more than a month leading me to finally start on my google journey again and begin to go down the rabbit hole of different problems I could possibly have Until I got double vision I was almost convinced I had esophagus cancer It was crazy I googled stuff all the time cried over things I might have worried about it till I fell asleep But I never really expected the new thing called MS i saw in passing was actually going to end up being me It was crazy Every single part And as you can already expect its fueling even more even worse anxiety as I try to figure out some current bowel problems that have been plaguing me since my diagnosis last year Today I made it a job for me to find out what is going on Ive made my way up to taking 290 mg of Linzess a day and still deal with constipation unless I decide to have a fun day out I always have to go to the bathroom anyway throughout the day whether or not I actually end up going I started having lower right dull pain halfway into my newfound constipation and was told the linzess would help It didnt Then we decided to try more It helped for a week Im vaguely aware or trying to convince myself that drinking more water should help because Im supposed to with linzess or i risk becoming dehydrated but its been hard to keep up with TMI but because Im nervous and desire opinions I must go on My stools are pale and light a lot of the time Yellow or white mucus covers some of it and half of it floats half doesnt Most times I go I bleed a little after and this past time quite a lot A bright red glop of blood which just didnt seem right for what couldve been a hemorrhoid or something else I usually always feel some kind of discomfort or dull pain in my abdomen across the lower side usually and recently I even had a blood test taken that said my blood count was low This may be because for MS reasons Im trying to cut down on red meats and arent getting enough iron But it doesnt seem right At all All these symptoms line up down to the anemia Im worried beyond compare of anything else before Nothing from anyone helps because theyre just repeating their words before my MRI Im scared I already panicked and cried and called mom and Im going to tell my neurologist tomorrow to see what she has to offer in guidance I can only hope Im not this unlucky getting two incredibly rare health problems for my age and form and everything else in the same damn year even I just dont even know where to start at dealing with this,Anxiety/Stress

cannot even muster the energy to deliver my rant Which is actually just a series of observations about the realities of living in modern society feeling unfulfilled with the progression of life and the brutal ways people treat each other in the name of profit The same observations I have been making since I was twelve years old But I guess I do not really need to do that here we all know more or less exactly the way each of us feels about how life works it is why we congregate in places like these People think we are looking for advice or sympathy a shoulder to cry on In some cases that is true but when we have reached the end of what we think we can endure and we are sitting in front of our screen holding a bottle of pills or that length of rope we have been tying over and over to get just right would not want it to fail when we need it most We Know that noone has the words to give us to make it better That magical set of words that will fit in a character limited text box and will wipe away all the sorrows and pains of our lives The miraculous advice given by a stranger that knows nothing of the specifics of our hardships that will rejuvenate us and show us a new light that will guide us in life NO We came here for ourselves Our last ditch effort our last vestige of hope that by sharing our stories and our plans and our pains we can gain the clarity and strength we need to keep struggling through these trials Or that with the commiseration of those that see the world the way it truly is we will finally find the courage to end them I hope you discover in the process of releasing yourself the Will that you need to keep on fighting for your life Until I find my own way to that decision I am still here Riding The Fence Apathetic Humans are scumbags,Suicidal

Blood in Stool Alright so this is an issue Ive had on and off for years and I dont know what to do So basically sometimes I have red spots in my stool I say spots because it doesnt fill the whole bowl the whole stool isnt red just red spots It also appears on my toilet paper time to time Im 21 now and the first time anything happened was probably 5 years ago Doctor did an occult test found nothing but a hemroid sent me on my way with a cream and I was fine for a while Its happened on and off since then and usually I either know its hemroids or I can trace it back to something red I ate Recently however its gotten worse About a month ago as my semester was ending there was about a week where I had stomach pains and twice in that week my stool had these red spots I went to a local walk in clinic and had another occult test done and it also came back nevative The doctor said it was probably something I ate Ive been fine this past month but I just flew back from Europe and twice in the past 3 days Ive noticed the same red spots Now each time it happened I had a red fruity drink the day before so I still dont really think its blood but if thats the case wouldnt it appear as a liquid in the bowl and not a spot as Ive described Part of me wants to go to the doctor but I was just verified a month ago that it wasnt blood and I feel going again will just lead to the same result Im just wondering is it normal to have any redness in your stool once in a while from food and Im just overly vigilante as health anxiety definitely has made me or is there more to it Thanks for reading,Anxiety/Stress

I have never been good with Reddit or even sharing stuff about my life but I will try to post something that is not a messI am not sure where to start because I have never been able to track the source of all my miseryI am a male on his early 20s Raised by a single mother never had any paternal figure that would teach me how to become a manI am what you would call a peak introvert I HATE talking to people interacting with strangers I am AWFUL with women even if I am not attracted to one I still feel extremely awkward and make a fool of myself I can make friends and conversate with people if I had to but most of the time when anyone talks to me I can barely wait for them to shut up and stop talking to me no matter who they are I just get lost on my thoughtsI never had a girlfriend but did met someone online not long ago with whom i established some sort of virtual ldr We talked for years until she got tired of waiting That brought me down even further The glimpse of hope I had for a normal life was lost I get easily lost on my train of thought so i do not even know where I am going with this lolBut anyways the point i try to convey is that I am weak I am extremely weak and have always been Every time i was faced with adversity I would give upI joined football teams with my friends and when they stopped going or I started making a fool of myself during the games I would stop going I would give up at the first shortcomingI dropped out of college on the second week because I had to make a presentation and i was scared to talk in front of the whole class Who on earth does thatI have no passions no hobbies other than sleep waste money and time on the gym seeing crappy results in strength and size play videogames just to kill time even that does not please me anymore destroy my brain even further watching porn and wallow in my own misery So my freaking life is a mess right now If I really cared I know I could do something about itbut do I care No sir I do not care what befalls me what befalls my family or what befalls the worldEver seen that Spiderman web of shadows meme that is exactly how I feel My world falling apart but I am just walking right through the middle like nothing is happening because I do not care I turned my back on GodI am no man I am garbage I am a worm I am nothingAm i seeking for help Am i seeking to get out of this place i find myself in Will i listen to advices What can you do when you do not care When you feel like life is always against you That when you feel like trying you try and then boom you are immediately denied of any form of improvement no matter what you try because you are freaking weakSorry for the messy post English is not my first language and i lose focus very easilyThanks My life is falling apart and I could not care less,Suicidal
I am currently in the military Stationed pretty far away from home For a good while I thought everything was fine in terms of my mental health but it turns out I had completely disconnected from all emotions because I was hurting The combination of many events in my life recently really took a toll When I went home I realized all of this and it was a difficult wake up call I had fallen into a very deep depression that I feel like I can never climb out of Now I am trying to make myself stay connected to my emotions but I feel like everyday I wake up there is this plague that has itself tangled in my mind I had so much going well and I just slipped away so much Its like I watched myself deteriorate over the past few months I completely disconnected from friends and family and my relationship When I went back home everyone said I had changed and that I was not as fun to be around anymore When I finally opened up to everyone about what Id been bottling up I was told you should have opened up sooner and what you did really hurt me and a lot of other people mainly my girlfriend The only one who really understood was my mother I have tried to make it better and show I still care about these people but they tell me its not enough I am aware of what I did but I did not know how to stop it and I did not know how to open up about any of it I feel like no matter how hard I fight this battle with depression I will inevitably lose one day and in many ways I feel I already have I just want everything to get better I do not know how to start I just wanted to post because I feel like my support will just throw it in my face if I try to talk to them about it because its happened so much before Thanks everyone for your support I am fighting a losing battle,Depression
Was wondering if anyone else has a coping mechanism like mine on a quest to feel normal I guess I find some of the things I realize about my mental illness funny and even come up with jokes about it though nobody around me likes themMy latest joke is realising how much I think about my own deathsuicide makes me makes one thing clearI need to find a better hobby Finding it funny,Depression

I really hate myself rn I just lost probably one of the best and closest friends ive ever had idk what i did wrong she told me that i was being strong on her idk wut that means being hard on her or pushing it to far and she says that some of my jokes make her feel uncomfortable I got mad and said if u dont wanna be friends anymore then thats fine goodbye I really wish I didnt say that cuz then she blocked me on insta snap and twitter and even my number I reached out to another friend to ask her why she did that the response I got was that my friend just wants to be left alone Idk if that means she doesnt wanna talk to me anymore or if she just wants to have a lil space for a while idk what makes me more anxious is that we both work at the same place and thats how we meet and became close friends before all this she really liked talking to me and she thought of me as like a best friend that shes known for years even tho we only known each other for like 2 years now and she really gets my humor and I think of her as like a big sister figure to me she always askes me if im feeling down when i am I tried reaching out to my other friends to help calm me down and try my best to forget about what happened but nothing worked My friends and other people just say people come and go but it doesnt help or work I just want my friend back and I wanna talk to her again before all of this happened I dont even know,Anxiety/Stress
I cannot rely on family I cannot rely on friends I am all alone in this I cannot do it anymore The only thing that remotely helps me cope is alcohol I have always been such a calm and loving person but recently my family and friends have made me so mad I just want to scream and beat someone to a pulp That feeling scares me because I have always been so loving and now I have this anger and frustration that I feel is eating me from the inside out So I try to deal with it by drinking better to hurt myself and my liver than other people Everyone is unreliable,Depression
this is my first reddit post also my first time sharing this information with anyone but i can t really keep it in anymore man so bear with me hopefully there s a psychiatrist out there that will read this and hit me with some world altering advice because there is absolutely no way in hell i will ever tell anyone especially not a doctor or psychiatrist what you are about to read but i really just need to get this out there first and foremost no im not going to kill myself let s get that out of the way but i do think im depressed i wa telling myself it wa just a life slump for a long time then i wa telling myself it wa just sadness from the slump now i ve literally been sad and thinking negatively of myself almost every day for like a year and i got ta talk about it with someone even if someone is this phone screen i ve always had major self esteem and confidence issue not really sure what it stem from but i have always felt inferior to those around me which btw i can not believe people live life happy with their appearance that is a blessing that people take for granted anyways ive done some research and educated myself with the science behind depression and i believe that over the past few year a mix of rapid lifestyle change and stress related event ha caused me to have depression the part that confuses me is that while my life is on the more stressful and busy side of thing i don t feel like it s a bad life to live i have wonderful friend family i have a great scholarship to a good school i do fun thing and go to party and drink i feel like an average person put in my shoe would be happy and excel if they had any drive or passion at all which i do not probably why i fuck everything up all the time it is common for me to have suicidal thought i really don t know why since in reality i wouldn t want to kill myself i may be a piece of shit but im not selfish nor do i like the pain of self harm i am self aware of these thought and i have attempted breathing and thought altering method to get rid of them but they pierce my heart and mind like a dagger it physically hurt they are not always about suicide but they are always very negative targeted at myself i just can t help staring out at the edge of that cliff wishing i had the nut to finally end it all sometimes i can t look at myself in the mirror because i know it ll lead me to thinking negatively about myself just at the sight of me and a sad a it is to say it i really just do not like myself i look in the mirror and want to smash it or rip my face off because of how ugly i am objectively and on paper i am not the worst looking guy im and im physically fit but holy shit i swear what i see in the mirror and what other people see when they look at me must be completely different there have been a few instance in recent month of people tell me im decent looking or im good looking or i have a nice body and i take the compliment and try and try to see it in myself but i just can t i literally can t i don t see it i don t know where you guy are looking but i truly don t see what you see okay it s not just about my appearance i find myself annoying and awkward i try to be a happy go lucky guy most of the time usually bringing conversation and a smile and sarcasm and even some humor sometimes but behind my smile is most commonly a frown im fucking annoying my thought scream at me at how what i just said is so stupid and i need to shut the fuck up why do i talk so much why would i ask that ect i talk too much sometimes i say thing i dont even mean or agree with just to say something i never know when to talk and when not to and it frustrates me a lot im volatile and irritable and ugh i fuck up most thing i do work school relationship you know how it go the classic poor me self pity i ruin everything type shpeal something about the way i wa made is just wrong i guess that s another one of those negative thought that repeat in my head a lot born wrong today i had the pleasure of envisioning myself fist fighting myself beating my own face in felt great honestly wish i could ve made it a reality i can t find happiness in any of the thing i used to enjoy ive gradually stopped all my hobby except for the gym which is where i take my anger out usually i have a lot of that i can t even sit through a movie without thinking what is the point of me doing this what is the point life feel numb pointless i go about my societal life just like everybody else i study work play sleep rarely but it all feel the same a gray bland mesh of nothing even something like eating delicious food i just don t get enjoyment anymore the best way i can explain how i feel is if im with people and someone make a joke that people laugh at of course i laugh but if nobody else laughed i would never know when to laugh honest opinion of myself i fucking suck im lazy and i lie all the time to keep up a persona of not being a sad downer hater fuck i constantly make poor decision and can t seem to learn from previous one im ugly the only thing im good at are mansplaining and making a fool of myself i say dumb shit and get shit on for it what kind of asshole ha the privilege and opportunity that i have and is still sad and lazy like this im the type of person that wa actually just wired wrong in the head and the fact that i try and try to be appreciative of my life and still can t disgust me to be honest i don t even know who i am a few month ago someone asked me what my hidden talent is i replied nothing i don t have one i really don t have a talent or something im good at and seeing people around me do amazing thing and then watching myself dig deeper and deeper into this rut really hurt i do not feel like this id say about 0 of the time i forget about all my stress and worry and appearance and fuck ups and im actually happy then when the happy go away i realize that whatever made me happy is so very temporary and it all come flooding back im just running around my mess of a life chasing those euphoric mindless high and happiness that seem to get weaker and shorter each time i find them the question i find myself asking often is why why am i doing this why do i feel this way why did i say that why did i do that why am i a certain way yadda yadda i am a realist i also truly believe there is no point to this life why do we all live such stressful unrewarding life putting all our effort in just to die and be forgotten forever i read comment on post like these saying that life is beautiful meet everyone you can experience nature get help it get better it can get better but the thing is no it can t everyone s situation is different i guess but where im at and what im doing nothing gon na change im not going anywhere even if i wa it wouldn t matter societal standing and fancy job position mean nothing human are not made equal everyone is different special in their own way therefore some people are biologically and factually better than others whether it s stronger larger smarter faster people are different and some trait are preferable i just happened to get stuck with the trait that make me fucking suck at life no amount of meditation or antidepressant fuck big pharm is going to change who i am people don t change painting a leopard red doesn t remove his spot it just hide them temporarily well it s and im going to the gym at and then lecture after that so i guess i should sleep a few hour so my motor function stay working so i can keep going on in this endless cycle of pointless effort thanks for

Background I have suffered from bouts of depression for most of my life I am 27 now plus anxiety to varying extents and Autism Spectrum Disorder as wellI take meds for impulse control and depression management and have done so more or less steadily since early 2013 with usually pretty steady positive results and only occasional ups and downsRecently though I have been feeling very unsettled by the fluctuations in my mood and daytoday or hourtohour sense of wellbeingI started a new job early last month and have enjoyed it thus far but another facet of my situation is that I feel as if I cannot connect to my peers no matter how much I want to And believe me I doit is like the main thing I am lacking is healthy human connection but the number one thing I am recoiling against as my brain seemingly tries to jump on a sword is healthy human connectionToday was particularly hellish at times I felt totally normal sociable and human while at others I felt varyingly like ripping the worlds throat out with my teeth or jumping off a cliff into oblivionOne thing that really set me off was the realization that I had more work to do when I thought I was actually done for the daysomething that set me off enough to become openly testy around coworkers and to become violent towards myself on the way home in the form of pounding the heel of my hand on the hard plastic top of my cars console and listening to metal music at the stereos max volumeDoes anyone have any suggestions for things I can do in the shortterm to prevent further or god forbid worsening outbursts and the seeming descent of my mind into dark places Please amp thank you What is wrong with me Genuinely concerned my medicine is not working andor my mental health may be deteriorating,Depression

I have been depressed with suicidal ideation since I was 11 I am currently at the worst I have ever been I think at this point killing myself is inevitable My daughter is nearly 2 I honestly feel like the best thing to do in this situation is to just get it over with now so that she does not remember me rather than devastating her 2 5 10 years from now It would also mean she would not suffer through having a heavily depressed mum I should not have had her but she was conceived on contraception after I would gone 2 years without a depressive episode and while pregnant I felt like me and my partner were in a good enough place emotionally and financially to give her a good life I now feel like I was a stupid fucking idiot Need an outside perspective,Suicidal

Havent worked a job in a year and a half pitiful rant The last job I had was back in October 2021 doing lowskilled IT work at a hospital and I got fired worked there two months the longest Ive ever held a job Im in my early 20s and its embarrassing to admit that but its true I cant keep a job I either quit after a short while or in this instance get chucked out ampx200B Since then Ive avoided work all together as all I feel is bitterness and shame Another deterrent is how Im not good at anything in particular All I can get are shit jobs where Im completely replaceable ampx200B Im too shy and anxious all the time so talking to people is really hard When I worked at a cinema it wasnt too bad because there were people my age and I felt good talking to them but that job went to pieces because management hated me long story ampx200B Im told to get a skill but the idea of getting a trade sounds harrowing to me as Ive worked on construction sites and the people who work there are usually abrasive cokeheads who I really wouldnt get along withtolerate ampx200B All Ive done for the past year is read write listen to music and occasionally socialise but Im pretty much alone now I guess when youre socially isolated its hard to really know yourself like you cant test yourself much in a public setting so its hard to truly know who you are I find it hard sometimes Just thinking about what jobs would suit me it seems impossible I know what I dont want to do but thats pretty much everything to be honest The idea of working a job again commuting forcing myself to speak to people who I dont want to be around and doing these mundane things feels like death isnt so bad Considering the sort of jobs I can get which are garbage service jobs or lowskilled office ones with high turnovers ampx200B So Im stuck I feel really trapped The job centre is harassing me and I hate going in there as I feel like such a lowlife but on the same token I can barely afford the upkeeps for my car so Ill have to work some shit job soon I suppose ampx200B Im not on medication or anything I feel embarrassed typing this out Im scared of telling anyone my problems as I was always told theyre insignificant and I should man up even though the same people who told me that complain and talk about how bad their lives are all the time to me and never ask about how Im doing So whatever Seeing a GP in this country is a joke anyway so theres zero point trying to get help anyways I tried to be ambitious and maybe move countries but I dont even have any qualifications like I dont have a degree so my options are very limited Id love to move countries and just forget about how bad my life sucks here but I cant do that regrettably so I guess Ill have to accept my lot in life working these miserable hapless jobs until I eventually murder myself or go crazy,Anxiety/Stress

Everything I do is an attempt to fail Even when I do something to occupy myself to stop thinking and being in action even if it is not an important thing I fuck it up that is why I have stopped trying a long time ago Failure is something I am used to but since it happens to me all the time it makes me more furious every time it is like I am no good in anything A fucking useless piece of shit But now that I suck at simple hobbies like repainting a chair Yo I am done It makes me so mad How could I be positive minded if I am a shit in everything Jesus I am unhappy doing nothing and I am unhappy doing things because I fail instantly What is left to do now I am a fuckup,Depression

here is the thing with gaining confidence you have surrounded yourself with people who judge take advantage do not actually care think of you as a joke and you put up with it because you do not believe deserve better For a long time I was like that and finally in my marriage it got pushed too far She took the kids back to our home town and left me in the city by myself for 6 weeks I told her not to we fought about it lots until I finally said do whatever tf you want After she returned was the first thing I told her I wanted a divorce I will change I will be different The usual except she did not change and a month later things were back to the way they were before being a 2nd rate citizen to her family constantly worried about her being happy first and always me second Few months later I began asking for a divorce again and again and again until finally she threatened me with the kids you will never see them I will make the divorce a shit show I will move home with them basically using the thing I fear the most against me After about a year of continuous deterioration I started to become close friends with girl I knew we had a connection but nothing inappropriate happened yet After about a year was the first time I tried to kill myself because I could not handle not having my kids and I was trapped We got in a fight brought on me borrowing my brothers truck to help another friend move out of an abusive relationship long story but tldr basically had his truck too long so he freaked so I skipped meeting my wife for lunch so she freaked because people only think about themselves I was intercepted walking to the overpass and hospitalized for a week Took her 24 hours to visit Which is when I found understanding no judgement and acceptance in this friend and a relationship started in secret Few months pass still asking for a divorce she takes the kids again for 5 weeks and still nothing moving towards separating and I tell her about my affair I am done She explodes how could you cheat on me you will never see the kids etc etc UNLESS you never see the mistress again here is the asshole part is that she was an acquaintance of my wife friends I am not sure not like they were close but nonetheless it happened She said we would have an amicable divorce 5050 custody no bs I agreed broke it off put the mistress through hell gave it up not have my kids subjected to this And then nothing happened 2 months of sending mediation services to her until she finally says she is not going to cooperate I reached back out to my girlfriend to mend things after barely to not at all talking the last 2 months and things get on the mendForward to Christmas I leave early for work in order to see her my ex wife packs the kids in the car at 530 in the morning to find my truck there and tells my 7 year old everything How much of a pos I am how I cannot be trusted Acts like she is finding out we are together for the first time and this part I will never get over my sister and brother are at my house telling her to keep the kids away from me get a lawyer fk me up as much as possible my exwife verified this in one of her fits so she keeps the kids from me over Christmas I came close enough to killing myself again that I spent all of Christmas in the hospital Literally the worst experience of my life That was 6 months ago she is slandered me to everyone we know have not talked to my family in months nor do I want to and I am completely alone I have never felt loneliness like this I have a knife now but do not have the balls to go through with it I wish I had my guns Probably could have been over long ago I am trying to convince myself my kids will be fine maybe that is the hesitation there is really nothing else holding me back the 2 youngest will not even remember me should not make any difference to them it is my oldest I do not want to hurt him but he would me better off with someone who was not such a mess AITA Just did not want to be with her,Suicidal

Hello everyone I just turned 22 years old and I feel like worthless peace of shit Through a lot of time I feel great about myself I can stay really positive but at times facing parents criticism for living in hothouse environment makes my emotions so high that I want just disappear and only then I started to see my negatives and realising how much more work I need to do I feel worthless becouse I am really good looking guy I used to approach about 30 females in one year confidentiality but nothing of it worked I feel like if I would chase them I will never have the one I deserved and my life going to be miserable I read 28 books in year although in my whole lifetime I read only few I really try as much as possible to push me through this situation but everytime I do I fail I want to study psychology becouse for few years I used to suffered anxiety attacks besides that I probably need to pass some exams from high school which makes me not believe in myself becouse my past results were not the best since I did not used enough efforts to learn I thought I will play sports professional I also failed 6 times on my driving exams which also made me believe that I am not capable of anything I drive pretty good but then exams come I cannot cope with stress and feeling exhausted I do not really know how I keep pushing myself still trying after that much failing I do not know how I keep that up Suddenly I understood how fast time goes and I start doing everything to improve myself I became really desperate with a mindset now or never My biggest fear is not to have a girlfriend I want in terms of looks and not having a private house I really know it is possible to achieve it for me but I do not know how how to cope with negative thoughts that you will fail again how to remove fair of rejection and how to be very independent since my parents are very controling so it is hard for me to do independent choises alone I understood that if I will define my passion in psychology I can be really successful and dedicate all the time to it but I still need come long way becouse it is now my life and I am fully responsible of myself I do not blame anybody for the concequences happened to me I took all my responsibility for myself I want to say to others I did not gave up then it was hard so you too will not give up for me I feel like I am not living and just existing becouse everytime I fail and something I gave up for couple of months and tough myself as biggest failure in the world I understand that I need to get a lot more rejections from jobs interviews and people to beat the fear of rejection I feel really stuck that I cannot achieve some pretty easy goals for longer time then others I know and feel that now is the time to rise above and achieve my dreams overwise I will live with regret for rest of my life I even regret things I did not do earlier like searching for my passion and wasting time with snowflake friends which were friends for me just for their needs In addition I want to begin trading stocks but my parents said it is risky and I am afraid to doing it I really hope someone experienced some alike situation and if not alike tell me how I can get through this everyday anxiety and achieve my goals the only good thing I guess that I still have plenty of timeI really try hard sometimes but maybe it is not enough it is hard to live with constant pressure and self guilt everyday of not being who you truly could be I also hit gym and was fit as never before but then covid began I gave myself excuses and quit gym Thank you in advance I told my parents that I will go to work my first job at grocery store just to get a work experience and bit of independence I need your advice guys,Suicidal

I am not actively suicidal and I am not planning on trying to kill myself anytime within the next year or two not until I start living on my own The fear of failure outweighs my desire to stop living But I have an entire plan for ifwhen I decide to do so I am only 19 but I have typed out a will of sorts to let my family know how I want to be buried and where I want my money that I saved for college to go I have a general idea of how I want to kill myself where I want to do it the time of day I want to do it how Ill lie to make people not be concerned etc But even though this plan has only come to me within the last week I have not been suicidal I am just stuck in that awkward limbo where I do not see a point in living but I do not see a point in dying But I still cannot stop just creating this story in my mind of everything thinking about everything that could go wrong and how I could prevent those things from happening and it does not really bother me Its just a thought that is always in the back of my head Anyone create elaborate suicide plans without intent to act on them,Suicidal
And I still want to diedo not get me wrong life is great sometimes It has its moments But the past 7 months has been nothing but down hillThe love of my life was assaulted and raped and she would not let me try to help her she stopped going to therapy convinced herself that she did not deserve me and five days ago she vanished Nobody can find her I have been absolutely worried and stressed out sick literally I have had to leave work multiple times due to throwing up from the stressMy dad got remarried not even a year after him and mom got divorced and now I have three strangers living in his house with me I feel like I have to be confined to my room to avoid them God I fucking hate them so much they are so loud and inconsiderate to meAll but two of my friends have left me due to trying to come to them with my problems since I cannot afford therapy or my medications anymore I have two weeks of meds left and after that I am going to have to figure out how to live without them I am so scared because these meds are the only thing holding me together anymore even if it is just a bandaid fixI have had a lot of what I thought were rock bottoms only to have a deeper rockier bottom underneath So I guess whatever happens next was meant to be I called the suicide hotline last night,Depression
HA over some yogurt I just ate I opened up a new container of yogurt today one of those big 2 lb ones and when I did I noticed there was some liquid as well as tiny holes covering the entire surface almost as if there were bubbles that gathered on top and then popped leaving behind tiny indentations Im not so worried about the liquid since thats common but Im wondering what those holes were I scraped off the top layer and the yogurt underneath seemed fine so I ate it but now I cant stop thinking about the possibility it might have been bad I know I cant do anything about it now but my mind keeps fixating on the thought that it wasnt safe to eat and Im somehow going to get sick Does anyone have any words of advice that might help to calm my anxiety about this,Anxiety/Stress

A little backstory me and my girlfriend I have gone through some things but we have been OK for a while recently I have been dealing with depressionMy depression is like this I have depression where I can barely even speak I do when I am told just so I can go back to my room into my bed and watch movies I have not even turned on my bedroom lights that is a staple of my room I have been super tired lately where I just fall asleep I took a shower yesterday and I basically felt so tired and I could not even stay awake I cannot even pull myself together do you even form a sentence I have not even change clothes or cleaned up my bedroom from my sleepover because I felt so like what is the point I have not even looked for my TV remote to use my TV I just want to use my phone to watch thingsI basically only had instant noodles today and I did not even finish that I went downstairs for that and water and only downstairs to do things my mom asked so I can quickly go back to my bedroom and be depressedI told my girlfriend about it and she basically said we had the same depression when for a fact I know we do not she goes out and gets drunk with her friends she is surrounded by family that gets to help her and cares when I am surrounded by family that just keeps to themselves most of the time she gets to have all these supportive friends to text and everything well the only two people I get that are my best friends do not really ever talk to me I do not really show that they care about my mental healthI just feel like me and her do not deal with depression in the same way And it kind of upsets me how she claims we do when were the fact we do not I just do not know how to feel or what to do I just feel really heard that she would claim we have the same depression Told my gf abt my depression trys and says we have same depression,Depression

I have struggled with suicidal ideation off and on since I was 12 I am now well into my 30s I am really afraid and yet in a weird way relieved at the feeling that I am heading for a suicide attempt again tonight My husband has not tried to be romantic with me in so long I could not even tell you how long it has been I am a very self conscious and introverted person but I have managed to make myself be the one to instigate physical affection multiple times recently despite my feelings that my husband does not even want to be with me He has rejected me every time only addressing it later by saying he was tired or had too much to drink even though I know he was not drunk at the time After a lot of other strains on the relationship I will not go into for brevitys sake I finally heard him admit tonight that he is not interested in me romantically anymore When asked why he does not just divorce me then he says he wants me to be his partner This makes no senseI do not want to be around to be a burden on anyone And I am so desperately lonely He knows how lonely I am because despite myself I have told him so while crying multiple times I do not want to do this anymore I am pointless and unloveable I just do not want to be here anymore The sick thing is I am not even really posting this in hopes of help I just want to be heard for once and it feels safest to say it to strangers who do not even know my name let alone anything else about me I am sorry I wasted your time with my drama Thanks for listening I hope you all have or find happiness I am a waste of space and being around hurts too much,Suicidal

I do not know why I am venting or what the point of this is I just went essentially no contact with my toxic pool of relatives and mother father etc I have moved every far and things have been a shit show to say the least and while I am able to navigate all of these situations that arise I am mentally fatigued from it all I have been pulling hat tricks for a year and a half and I do not know for how much longer I can keep it up I get that resilience and perseverance is key but people telling me that I am insanely strong and all of these useless things I would just rather not hear I also wonder how when people give me this praise how am I actually doing all of these things on my own I have no shoulder no open ear I have only myself to depend on and while I guess it is always been like that being on the fly in the desert has put a different perspective on things for me I hate that I did not leave my family earlier I hate that I endured the abuse manipulation lying and gaslighting for so long So mad I did not realize the fake friendship and passive indifference So upset with myself for letting these things fly right over my head I know better I know I know betterI can only look forward but it is hard to want this for myself only I am definitely not the type to kill myself but I do selfsabotage and I know this All these tiny things keep cropping up putting just even one more small obstacle in front of me and it is starting to weigh on me I do have a formal diagnosis two and am currently unmedicated but also without medical coverage atm due to all the moving and running away stuff I have combed my mind for every possible alternative in this situation and am grateful I am still clear enough of mind to make safesound and wise decisions for myself Asking for help tends to be useless as I can come up with bettermore efficient alternatives myself And sometimes when I talk to people about all the shit I am doing and have to do they just stare in awe of how I am juggling and handling all these things unmedicated and not strung out right now not an appropriate response Whatever I guess not everyone is as strongforward thinkinghard working as I was made out to think everyone had to be good I am proud of who I am at this age I always strived to be a wellrounded young adult growing up to be a good partner to whoever I am with and at this age I think I can say I have achieved those things I will always be working to better myself as you should never stop working on yourself and there is always room to make improvementsNobody said it would be easy but nobody said it would be so hardI will spend my 25th birthday in a I land I am unfamiliar with by myself with the most peace of mind I have ever had in my entire life I think I have won Hats off to breaking generational trauma bonds shit sucks but someone is got to do the foot work But yes it is depressing Hate it but love this for me,Depression
Ive lost myself to depression conflicted self inflicted misery has made me numb I thrive off academic validation Having become stagnant in every way possible and unreachable has made me cold hearted The only way to numb the non reluctant pain is through expressive amount of work At all times Ive had depression for ten years and have the diagnoses of chronic depression Being a remarkable student doesnt fix the pain It numbs it If I dont indulge in work then my depression hits Filling my brain with work excludes me from killing myself The amount of work does at least give me an accommodating future Being caught up in this misery of perfectionism is ruining me What I fear most is summer vacation I cant stand vacation The time where I drive myself nuts on my own Signing up for lecture after lecture I really am in misery but I am too numb to cry I am waiting for vacations so that I can work myself to an extent just over manageable An extent that makes people worried if they knew Even though people only see a little glimpse of my sickness I am very very sick I am aware but also so sick that Ill always keep going,Depression

general narcissist venting feel free to comment if you wantThe thought of dying without being able to see if anyone cares or not just fucks with me too much to actually commit suicide I mean of course they would care People even care when strangers die The initial shock of someone you knew dying and knowing that you could not do anything about it is very traumatizing But I think what would affect them is the idea of a family member dying and not that they would miss things about me or reminisce over memories or anything like that The only memories they have of me is me being a dumbass or saying what five times in a row because my hearing is goingBut the thought of this makes me want to go out and be something that I know I cannot be I want to make something of myself but I just I cannot I have nothing to put on my resume I cannot do taxes there is so many obvious things that other people know that I just do not And nobody thinks to tell me because I should already know Why do not I already know basic crap Why did I spend my childhood locked in my room instead of trying to learn and develope like a normal child Why cannot I take care of myself without burning out If I brush my teeth shower get dressed and do my hair routine all in the same day then I am burnt out that is it I cannot do anything else for the day I am too tired there is no way I could work or get a job like this I would burn out after one task and get fired I hate that my huge sense of self importance has manifested into me always focusing on how I am the worst instead of atleast making me delusional enough to think that I am the best I hate that my self esteem is based on other peoples approval but unlike other narcs I do not get approval because I am literally shit at everything so I am just an unmotivated sack of shit who cannot do anything I hate that I even told anyone that I am a narc Of course they would not accept me What the hell was I thinking What kind of idiot would expect anything different Things are not going to get better for the NPD community not in my life time atleast Well maybe that will be another reason to stay alive Imagine being an old man and seeing 20 something year olds openly talk about their NPD recovery process that they felt no shame entering because there is no more stigma experiencing something I could not Maybe When I am in my 80s And my mom my poor mom She has to pay for everything because I cannot do shit on my own Physical therapy regular therapy medication my food I hate this You should not have to take care of me You should be relaxing somewhere without worrying about my next diagnosis or my next medication or whether or not any treatment is working You should be doing your hobbies and I should be the one buying you things Maybe I will get to the point of recovery where I am not so selfcentered and then I can finally let go And they can all finally live their lives I wish I was not such a narc so I could just find peace in death,Suicidal
On Sunday night I tried to kill myself by hanging I choked until I passed out and awoke violently gagging I ran to the bathroom and threw up and spent the rest of my night on the bathroom floor The next morning I spent my time walking around like a zombie and when I got home I thought I wanted to try again I decided to call mental health services and they decided I needed to get myself to the hospital After realising I am physically ok and there is no permanent damage I honestly feel lucky to be aliveDepression and suicide have surrounded me for the majority of my adulthood My dad committed suicide when I was 15 and I do not think I ever fully resolved the trauma from that event I have consistently felt on and off for the past few years but my suicidal thoughts culminated on Sunday night and resulted in me trying to take my own lifeMy ex girlfriend who I was with for nearly 6 years came over and repeatedly twisted and manipulated my feelings to the point where Id never felt more sick and used in my life I begged this person to come back in my life and I am deeply ashamed not because of showing feelings but because I now know that this person has never caused me anything but pain Over the years I feel that she conditioned me into complacency and gradually tore down my personality into the person who was happy to be stuck with someone like that for the rest of their life Looking back on it now in a calmer state and with the perspective that all the loved ones who have come by and supported me have provided I now realise there is not much of this person I wasted so much time and energy on that actually value or respect She could not talk or communicate like an adult She was incapable of seeing the effects of her actions on other people She was selfish She made poor decisions and was incapable of looking after her health and hygiene properly She had very few friends and repeatedly drove people away due to her personality She was always so quick to judge and criticise others especially me without ever turning the magnifying glass back on herself She humiliated my sister about her botched tattoo despite having an absolute clusterfuck of poorly assembled tattoos mismatched all over her thighs She hated cheaters and how people functioned in their relationships yet complained about me to her male friend and gaslit me into thinking I was crazy for hurting from it She criticised other peoples health and appearance yet only continued to gain weight without doing a single thing to change She often shamed me for how I chose to dress despite often having pretty poor hygiene and being quite unappealing as a result I now realise just how much this person had thoroughly poisoned my floor and convinced me I was not worth anyones time or effort Begging for her affections is the most regrettable thing I have ever done because I now realise that this was the ultimate symbol of how she would conditioned me to submit to her disgusting behaviour As she revealed details of getting drunk and sleeping with someone earlier in the week despite never wanting to be physical with me at the end confessed details of drinking alone recently and went back amp forth on getting back together to play with my feelings I think the veil broke in my mind and I finally started to see her for what she is This person that I had put so much time and energy into who I had thought I loved with all of my heart just uses people and discards them As I sat in the hospital and received an outpouring of support I realised just how little she had ever done for me Id received the most heartwarming messages of love and support from women I had slept with once and kept very poor contact with If all of these people Id only spent time with for one night just to get physical could offer so much support then why could not someone Id know for most of my adult life She blamed so much of her toxic behavioural and personality traits on past relationships and even puts her various supposed mental issues in her Tumblr biography as some sort of attention seeking excuse This person is just a complete fraud and I now realise what an absolute manipulator she was there is such a huge reason for her lack of success in making genuine friendships and the gross people she is now seeing are just even more evidence of the fact that she will take anything she can get as long as she can use them for something She has no dignity or respect in my eyes and I truly regret I let someone like this shape what could have been my last day on this earth Last night a complete stranger came up to me and told me as a dad he felt so much sadness and concern for my wellbeing that he had to say something He gave me a hug and told me that he saw how much love I have to give and I should not even be here After how much crying Id already done that way I could not believe how much hope I felt in my heart after hearing that from someone who did not even know me I would need 4 hands to count the number of people who have offered to come over who have spent time with me today and just given me a phone call to let me talk and finally express the pain I have carried for so so long Some of my dearest friends have been so fucking supportive and understood the pain and abuse I had endured for longer than anyone should have had to bear I am sure things will not always be easy and I know there will be times where my thoughts take over and I want to do something terrible But after the ordeal of the last few days I finally see the support that I have and just how much I have going for me despite not realising it I have made an interstate move happen all on my own and been approved for my dream apartment I am going out and meeting people and TMI having really awesome sex after being with the most stale and unfulfilling sexual partner I have ever had I go to the gym most days of the week now and find so much enjoyment in working myself physically to improve my health I put more time into my hobbies today and found renewed vigour for guitar practice and my music theory work I am practically drowning in job opportunities and have never felt so excited about the prospects in front of me There are so many good things on the horizon for me and one awful person should have never gotten in the way of thatAll this is to say I know that despite things not always going to be easy I am glad I survived and that I am going to be ok A lot of the work is on me and it will take a lot of effort but I know what I need to do If anyone has ever been in a position like mine where someone has treated them this way and they feel there is no hope just know that they are just one person who is trying to project their own shit onto someone else For every one person like that in your life you have 30 more who genuinely care and love you and want you to be ok It was true for me and I want this to be true to anyone who has gone through what I went through Attempted suicide on the weekend Now I feel so hopeful for the future,Depression

My dog is insanely attached to me and I love him so much he is my best friend I am his person And if I kill myself I know he will never be able to attach to anyone the same way and will just constantly be waiting for me to come home I wish there was a way to kill myself that would not traumatize him and make him feel like I abandoned him I wish there was a way to communicate to him that it is not his fault and I will not come back but it is okay and he will be okay I love my dog so much and I am actually cuddling with him and crying as I type this out now The thought of leaving him behind and alone is just as my depression I guess I am lucky to have him but God if and when I go through with it how can I forgive myself for leaving him alone I wish I could kill myself without traumatizing and abandonimg my dog,Suicidal

There are certain people who I care for make me suicidal and generally like a failure I would love some help just while I am stuck over the next few days I recently started taking antipsychotics They help me be more compassionate for my self The situation is I have not seen a close friend in a long time and took 2 weeks off my 3 jobs to see them They needed some help unpacking and with chores But there is always something wrong It does not help that there are sometimes feelings between usThe thing is I have done everything due to my people pleasing habits And I have been thinking what I already knew which is that I am doing this because of people pleasing I could have spent my very limited vacation with friends who actually make me happy and should not have committed so much but I commit to people I care about and do a lot for those who reciprocate care as I have been deprived of it and had to grow up very early But I had this need to please But I have failed in various tasks and am now counting down the days I have to stay here as leaving will because more issuesit is not that this person is bad it is just how our anxieties play out and interact And I recognize all my mistakes in particular listening to the idea of staying with this person and catering my schedule to do things for them and not doing all the things I wanted to doI just need help surviving the next two or three days with any help or relatable stories We have good times but a momentary issue ie if I do something too slowly or my two bags are visible out or bigger issues like messing up laundry this was the biggest or not waking up early or doing things based on their timelinethere are like 5 things I try to do in an afternoon and if I get 35 it is very bad sends me down bad paths and I think because I am on medication I am feeling my feelings and hearing inner voices that advocate me more than I normally do And the unpacking takes for ever but when they feel capable they do everything so well within a short time whereas I struggle immensely with even simple tasks because I always do them wrong and it is their space I know I will never stay with them again or schedule a trip where I just see them I just need help for the next few days and need to know if anyone else feels inadequate all the time or has made similar mistakes around certain people or dealing with people who are very particular Feeling suicidal around certain people and on anti paychotics,Suicidal

Hello my name is Lucas I have been dealing with depression for quite a few years now I am 23 turning 24 in september I feel like my life is just going further and further down hill recently its been a 90 downward fall I am heavily invested in computers and i love playing games sometimes it feels like my pc is the ONLY thing i have left in this world also because I am able to live in another reality for as long as my eyes are locked on to this screen I do not feel like going outside i barely speak back when spoken to that is my own choice for some reasonMy mother has a rare heart condition called Alcapa She has had 6 heart attacks and I have been a witness to multiple heart attacks she is had it is the freakiestscariest thing I have ever seen i truly believe witnessing your own mothers quote on quote death multiple times fucks with you hardcore Its a constant thought I did not go to school for almost a year after it happened And that set me way back in school so when i came back i knew nothing and i felt stupid So i ended up being the funnystupid guy in class making jokes at the teachers and being sent to the principals office many maaaaany times I never got good grades and that shit is hurting me so much right now not being able to get a decent jobA few years after it was discovered that my mother had Alcapa my dad left us all to start a new family at 48 Since i was the oldest at the time i took on a kind of a father role at 16 years old I have tried reaching out but he does not really care So I have stopped reaching out and making myself look stupid i will not ever lay my eyes upon that vile human being againWhen i was 20 i went to help one of my grandfathers friends paint he is house We had a few beers at dinner and i decided to sleep there for the night in the guest room I woke up early in the morning and this guy was sitting on the side of my bed and had he is hand in my boxers I freaked out called my mother and my little brother We called the cops and took him to court I cannot begin to explain to you how this ruins the way you look at yourself You feel dehumanized and it feels like your masculinity is taken away from you aswell as all of your dignity I am heterosexualAfter that happened i could barely look myself in the eyes when i stood in front of a mirror i still barely cannot I used to be muscular like VERY But it is all gone i look like sticks now My cheeks are inflated and i look like a skeleton When i look at myself i see a disgusting 23 year old who is 167 centimeters still looks like a kid and cannot grow a beard I cannot even go to the store and buy cigarettes without someone who is obviously younger then me asking for IDI had a job 5 months ago I made good money and it made me happy for a month my first pay was amazing But after that the job turned dull and extremely difficult and hard they did not have appropiate equipment for carrying heavy stuff we broke rules to almost break our own backs I came home with pain in my back everyday and yellow and blue marks all over my arms i had the job for about 3 months and then i got fired because my boss told me i was not working hard enough It made me snap and i said stuff i should not have but whatever I am happy I am done with that work but it really shocked me that people look at me like I am not doing anything when i really am putting in as much hard work as i canI owe companies money at 23 I have taken small loans that have evolved into large amounts nowI have had a feeling my life would be short ever since i was 1415 years old i do not know how to deal with this The thought of suicide has crossed my mind over 1000 times but i do not have the guts to go through with something like that that is why I have fallen closer to the natural death side of things I barely eat anything anymore like maybe a banana or something a day because the pain in my stomach is too much sometimes and I have started smoking alot more cigarettes just becauseI want help but i will not ask for it I have quit over 13 cigarettes on my own arm it hurts and i do not like it but i hope some day someone will notice my burn marks and ask what is wrong I probably will not tell them what is wrong and I have been thinking about it alot I feel like I am doing it for attention and I am NOT an attention seeker useually I useually love just being overlooked I am so confused I want this off my chest Thanks,Depression

I dont feel suicidal but I also dont see a purpose on going on I been dealing with depression for a long time now since I was about 12 or so my teen years were the worse for me as thats when I actually felt suicidal as around that time my parents were having a divorce and I was failing school never got the treatment I needed for this as my mother didnt like the idea of having to use drugs to make me better and never got me therapy either so I was left to somehow fix myself on my own for many years which I had to do many many google searches to figure out what is wrong with me Right now my depression has been getting worse due to my godfather passing away on 2023 new years and I had to put down my 16 year old cat 2 weeks ago and that has been hitting me hard I also dont have a job sadly to keep me busy and I dont have too many friends that live close to me that I can go out and do stuff withI do still try to talk to them through text tho but I was thinking on finding some kind of distraction like exercise but I havent found that motivation on moving forward yet I did finally set up a therapy appointment for myself but it took a lot of work to even set it up Im kinda just spitting word vomit out right now but one of my coping mechanism is Maladaptive Day Dreaming which if you dont know what that means is a behavior where a person spends an excessive amount of time daydreaming often becoming immersed in their imagination lately I have been stuck in my head a lot making up a bunch of stories and just wishing I could be in my perfect world that I made up and sadly its just making me even more depressed because I know I would never be able to live in that world like I would imagine myself being a superhero with powers but then I end realizing superpowers will never exist and I end up sad so basically I was wondering if anyone else has dealt with this before and what you did to make it stop because I want this to stop very badly as with my own selfawareness I can see where our world is a nice place and you can experience a lot of things but I never have the energy or motivation to experience it Sorry if this is a lot to read but Im at my breaking point and I dont know what to do with myself and I really want to make this emptiness inside me to go away Im tired of living in a dull boring world,Depression

Nobody give two shits about people who bring no value to them This is something we as suicidal people know the most about Everyone including in some cases parents in my case at least do not give two flying fucks about you your presence or your life unless your value outweighs the mental costs that they have to undergo to be around you however the second you show any negative emotion they are the first ones to shit on you to belittle you and negate all resemblance of emotion because they would rather believe their made up reality rather than understand the truthWhat kind of a shitty person would rather kick you to the curb in order to save face rather than help when something goes wrongMy mother has openly stated that she only had me when she found out I was a boy because of her being the youngest of her siblings and that she was the one who bore the first grandson to my grandfather we are an Indian family who moved to the US before I was born they had me and my brother then we moved back because my father had died and apparently that was a big deal to my grandfatherIts got me so fucked up that I literally feel the need to justify my existence by picking up skills that will be useful in the future I am good with computer I tinker with linux a lot and I can disassemble and reassemble a laptopWhat kind of parent justifies this but saying that it is right to own me simply because I was born to her What kind of parent belittles their child to the extent that they do not even fully comprehend the effect of what they are doingI am done with this life I am done with this existence and honestly I am done with this universe knowing that no matter how many times I die and am reincarnated wishful thinking I know that when I die I am just going to be erased from existence like I never even mattered that there will always be another person who is going through more than I am Nobody gives two shits,Suicidal

So I lead a pretty lonely life I am going to I work and play video games and go to the gym This is all I do with my life everyday and it has been feeling pointless and repetitive and i feel like I am stuck in a loop I do not have an outgoing personality and I prefer to be alone maybe because I am used to it and have become addicted to the thought of being alone and not needing anyone to rely on I do not find anything interesting besides the things I listed above I do like some activities like going to the movies or going on a hike but would feel weird with doing these activities alone so I find myself just sitting at home all day and repeating my same actions I am complaining about this lifestyle but also am not doing anything to stop it I understand I can change it by being more social and going out but I do not think its as simple as that its almost as if I cannot even though technically I can I do not have any friends and even if I do social activities with my family I still feel very alone Pretty much what I am asking is is there anyone out there who relates to how I feel or if they did how did they get out of this feeling This all started my freshman year of high school when I was 14 I am now 20 and I feel it has been the same I had a girlfriend for almost 2 years but that did not work out obviously that is why I am here lol I tried dating apps as well and it has not been working I am tall and I like to think I am attractive Not that it matters but yea I just would like to solve my issue as it is only getting worse Just wanted you to get a good perspective on my life and if there is anything wrong with me Just want to rant and see if anyone feels the same,Suicidal
So I will trainI will make my body physically fitI will make my mind as sharp as possibleI will become as competent as this body will allow so not caring about my instabilities could become an issueinconvenience for them or othersthat is the only way to be certain anyone will actually give a fuck about what I am feeling Nobody cares about how you feel until it is worth caring The only way to know for certain that someone cares is if not caring could because serious issues for them or others,Depression
So many posts I have read from teens and 20 year olds wanting to end it It makes me sad I was there and we really have no idea how little of the world we seen And how hopeless it really is not for the most part I have managed to make it this far But I am not entirely sure I am supposed to go much further I never saw myself getting old and maybe this is whyI ran away when I was 16 Dad left when I was five my mom was an alcoholic and had two more kids with a married man She died three years ago I have had a hard childhoodblah blah blahEver since I left home I have been fighting for a better life I believe life is choices You wake up and choose to be better then your past You recognize what is right and wrong and know how it feels to be bullied and not loved and demeaned so you choose to act the opposite embrace people and be there for friends because you know what it is like to be alone and you do not want anyone to feel like that like this Things are supposed to get better I am now 43 I have worked two jobs my entire life until I turned 40 and mentally could not take it anymore I have not been on vacation in over 20 years I have student loan debt do not go to college it is a scamLast year I was laid off from March until January due to Covid I had to move All my savings is gone I have 20 in my bank account I am tired I am supposed to return to work in August September at the latest The last three weeks I have thought about death Have written my note in my head over and over They say money cannot buy happiness but it can buy relief When you do not know how you are going to pay your rent and bills it gets overwhelming everysingle dayI see so many posts about people having good jobs and money and husbands and wives and kids People who have a good life but you still want to die there is no help I am not ready yet I still cry when I think of it but I am not scared to do it I am just not ready yet But the thoughts come more and more and I do not think it will be too long I am trying to memorize thingshow things feel smell and look Subtle differences that we take for granted every day or miss Like how someone is eyes light up or how a smile spreads across someone is faceSo my younger ones think about your life See the beauty in what you have You have so much a head of you and there is much joy in this world Love yourself You may think you have nothing and no one but if you think about it it is probably not true Find something anything to keep up the good fight And it can turn out good so I am told I am trying You try too Xoxo To all the Young,Suicidal

The only question I am left with in this shit hole of a world is Why Stay HereWatching the last 18 months where the idiot masses delight in the destruction of any remaining freedom that they had I do not want to live in a world where the government gets to threaten you for the basic freedom of leaving ones house where the government thinks it has the right to monitor ones every movement to place on under house arrest on a whim where the media supports the growing Orwellian State and attacks anyone who cares about basic freedoms as selfishExisting in this stifling world of control coercion mass governmental intimidation endless fear based propaganda to traumatise and psychologically abuse peopleThe only question that remains is why stay in this shit hole amongst the braying masses that celebrate as the State gains more and more control over them Every time the State gets this much control the end is a fucking disaster The history of man has been the few trying to gain freedom from the State and the stateworship of the cultist masses Be it on the left or the right fascism or communism same shit different colour flagWhat kind of evil fuckhead would come up with a system that functions like this world does Sure there are nice views and a few people left who value freedom over centralised authoritarian control systems but they are far between Sure there are some nice views but nature is a lying whore who beautiful costume is a deception on top of her uncaring cruelty If leaving this place was not so brutal and if one had not been programmed from birth to view carrying on regardless or that life is somehow worth it then what sane man would continueIf there is a Creator and I suspect there is then I hate this evil moron And if one tries to discuss these things one is just told meaningless platitudes Why is this because this place is such a shit hole that all one can find to offer the one contemplating these things is meaningless platitudesI wake up each morning to the endless Covid propaganda threats from the government and its propagandists endless coercion and intimidation from a police state that believes it can falsely imprison millions of people just cos its experts priest class says soWhat sane man would want to live in such a world And to top it all off whatever is behind this world programmed me with a body that cowers in fear at the thought of the pain and suffering requires it made me sympathetic to my fellow man so I dread to because more suffering to the ones that remainBut what kind of reason is this to carry on I must remain a slave to materiality and criminal fascist governments that want to control when I can leave my house and monitor all my movements and then lie to me that it is for my own safety and that or others which is classic Narcissitic abuseAnd then watch the masses defend their abusers like good little Stockholm syndrome slavesWhat a pathetic realm this is what a pathetic creator must be behind it and what pathetic amp servile creatures I am surround with Who would give up their childrens freedoms cos they are scaredAnd what a pathetic creature I am that can see there is no sane nor rational reason to remain here but am too scared to end it too servile to my programmed bodily desire to surviveWhat kind of world has to put up such sentinels against leaving it And why do I stay here and not depart Cos some fuckhead gave me a stupid material body that has chemical factories inside it that release drugs to create emotional states that keep me in this prison world And then people advise to to go and get help What from some therapist who was probably trained by the state my enemy who probably supports the covid bullshit who supports one of the most brutal attack on the health of mankind both mental and physical ever launched in the name of hypochondria and germophobiaWhilst there was a semblance of freedom to this place is what bearable but no one with a functioning soul can endure this level of constraint I only hope that either I can conquer this fear not of death by of dying or that my natural end is not far off anyway Why Stay Here,Suicidal
