I am embarrassed to write posts bc my posts do not really get any recognition now so i end up just deleting them 5 mins after writing them lol idk why I am writing this i just have nobody to talk to at all but I am cringing rn just writing it i need 2 get a journal or therapist bc the only way anyone would listen to my problems is if they were getting paid to do so or if they r an inanimate object who cannot say shit to me about being a whiney baby anywaysi have 1 friend who has ditched me bc he recently met someone on tinder he will literally only talk to me when he is not occupied with some guy hes seeingtalking to whenever one does not work out within a week he has someone else so this happens all the time I have never had a real true friend who has my back n i honestly believe at this point I have never experienced authentic relationships or friendships bc every one I have ever had has been fucked up n I am convinced I am incapable of lovingbeing loved loli cannot stop eating fucking shit and cannot make myself work out I am not really in danger of engaging in harmful behaviours i would say its just posting this type of shit on diet subs receives the wrong type of comments from ppl who do not realise i have an eating disorder I am not even sure if I am in relapse anymore or what its like i just do not give a fuck anymore but I am getting fatter and fatter and its making me more depressed the only thing that brings me joy or comfort is food i eat bc I am depressed i get even more depressed when i eat n gain weighti cba to talk to anyone except my friend who is ignoring me my family text me and i ignore them its a chore to reply to them and exhausting trying to act normal and i cba to tell them about how shit everything is for me rn it pisses me off bc my friend is studying to be some sort of mental health nurse therapist type person and literally the advice he gives me is to just help myself I am starting to really dislike him and resent himall i do is sit at home all day until i have to go to work on fridays saturdays and sundays its absolutely exhausting because I am shy and quiet and introverted and work with the public in a very intimate job so I am constantly having to be fake and polite and talk to people all day about shit i literally could not care less about all i can think when I am talking to someone is how much i want to be in a quiet room rn by myself and nowhere near them i finish one shift and I am absolutely drained mentally and physically and completely exhausted i had a pretty traumatising experience the other week where a guy came in for a massage i work in a spa and he got an erection during this and was being really weird with me and inappropriate and its really grossed me out everyone pisses me off and grosses me out I am so spiteful and mean nowadays i cannot stand to be around anyone i have the shortest temper and my patience is non existent whether I am driving at the supermarket talking to my friend or family etcat night i cannot sleep because my mind races and I am just so upset and fed up all of the time everyone i do socially interact with i just do not even want to talk to themi have not been on medication for a number of years now which did not even work but considering contacting a doctor and asking to be put on medication bc i do this shit completely alone i do not talk to anyone about shit i do not take medication and I am just fucking sick of carrying all this bullshit on my shoulders 247 I am just done n sorry for swearing so much i just cba embarrassingly long rant lol,Depression

I am going to share with you something that has always cheered me up and calmed me down whenever I get really anxious over my health So this sub only seems to really have posts from users describing their symptoms and trying to get diagnosed on Reddit now if that helps you with your anxiety thats cool however it can be counter intuitive as the whole googling and obsessing over symptoms is the actual problem we all came here to rid ourselves in the first place So I honestly do believe we should move more away from I have xyz symptoms am I going to die to How can I find peace of mind and stop googling One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of Hey Arnoldhttpswwwwcotvheyarnoldseason2episode5monkeybusiness2 which is my all time favourite show its only the first episode in the video provided called monkey business btw I wont ruin it for you all but its really funny and will hit home for all of us it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms Hopefully it can help you all in your journey in controlling your hypochondria like it has done for me,Anxiety/Stress

While most of the world is moving on from COVID half of my country is in lockdown Once I found out that my state was going into lockdown I cheered My job causes my depression which in turn makes me almost unable to lead a happy productive life I have not slept well for 3 years since I started this job Would suffer from onandoff insomnia No energy to enjoy my hobbies I would spend most of my postwork time in bed watching YouTube and napping It took me 2 years to actually start working out had a gym membership for almost 3 years before I went consistently The reason I have not even started university yet is purely because I am burnt out after work and can rarely muster up the energy to play a video game let alone study so basically I have not studied properly at all to get into university for 3 years I felt angry depressed anxious and almost inhuman everydayEver since lockdown started I have woken up with a smile on my face my depression is entirely gone I finally have motivation to do productive things and most of all I feel human again I feel like I am almost being gaslighted when I see how many people view lockdown as a terrible thingI am honestly hoping our lockdown gets extended because I simply do not want to go back to work the reason I am depressed in the first place Lockdown has made me the happiest I have been in as long as I can remember,Depression
I was diagnosed with severe depression when I was about 13 years old and I am now 21 For the majority of the past 8 years I never really struggled with showering or brushing my teeth etc however over the past year I have been severely struggling with caring for myself COVID had just started taking over the world and I found out that my family was moving to a different city I think both of those things really messed me up I stopped caring about my diet and gained a bunch of weight I am working on losing that weight now which will hopefully improve some things for me i feel like I do not have the energy to clean myself and I just feel like shit all the time In 2019 I was the happiest I have ever been I loved the way I looked I loved the way I treated myself and how I could do things for myself I got into an awesome relationship and things were just amazing Now I can barely step outside my apartment and just stay in bed all day After a year of being stuck like this and reflecting on my past I am ready to start pulling myself out of this slump and try to get things backs on track for myself I am open to any advice or helpful tips I struggle to care for myself,Depression
Brain cant function after a depression episode I am just curious that is there anyone just like me If yes I really need some advice I recently had a very bad depression episode few days ago and even though I am done with the episode and my emotions are more stable right now my brain doesnt seem to be functioning in any way I thinking of everything but nothing at the same time Like I really cant catch my thoughts or even think anything logically or sensibly And I feel like a zombie just do everything based on experience and instinct And the worst part is people dont understand that because you look completely normal and functional They think youre fine now because you stop crying or being depressed You can finish normal tasks or conversation because you are in autopilot mode but when it comes to something that requires more brainpower you are broken And sometimes it takes weeks or months to really snap out it but life doesnt give you the luxury of doing that It stresses me out How on earth do I suppose to do to deal with this,Depression
So I am suicidal ofc and i got taken into a clinic I am not sure if it will work or what ill do after But the problem is they told me if i beed to go to the hospital because of my self harm they will not let me in is this true Because now I am worried i think i need to go to a hospital but i also really want to get the help Being send to a mental clinic,Suicidal

Going to the cinema This is probably a very particular issue and Ive never really wanted to post about my anxiety but Ive led myself here anyway After a weed induced panic attack about 5 months ago things have been pretty hellish for me Ive got a painful feeling in my chest I would say the majority of the day anxiety of course every day Now I love love LOVE films I plan to go to college next year and study film Ive wanted to become a director for years now As youd imagine that requires me to be able to watch pretty much any kind of film whenever But going to the cinema something I hold so close to my heart as being a place I used to love a place I would go to escape has become really difficult for me I really struggle in the days leading up to going takes serious mental preparation Ive been a total of 6 times in 2023 which to people who know me is simply unheard of Im a big fan of the John Wick films and have plans to go see the 4th one tomorrow Ive been waiting a long time to see it but I just cant see myself actually going out and seeing it If youre aware of the John Wick films you know that theyre probably the most foot on the gas and brutal action films around Which I feel is going to really freak me out In my experiences of going to the cinema with anxiety Ive never had to leave the cinema Im pretty uncomfortable being there but Ive never had to leave I think that the main thing is the fear that this thing I love so much is being taken from me despite me having no evidence to support it While Ive been able to push myself to go all the other times I just cant see it happening this time I know its a lot of mental gymnastics but if anyone has ANYTHING to tell me at all Id really appreciate it Thanks,Anxiety/Stress

the title pretty much says it all there are periods of time where i feel better but then i force myself back into depression again because i feel I am not allowed to get better without the use of medication i know its dumb but i need to know how to stop feeling this way the days where i feel better make me want to not start on antidepressants because obviously i do not need them them if i can get better on my own and i know deep down that ill end up depressed again even if i do not force it but at the same time my brain convinces me that the only reason i do not get better is because i selfsabotage and that I am not actually depressed i do not even know if this makes sense ahahaha everything just seems so frustrating and unnecessarily complicated i just wish i was not here i feel like i do not deserve to get better unless i take meds,Depression

Sharp headache everytime I move or cough Figured I could come here for enlightenment since Im currently kind of on holiday Im 23 female and about a month ago I contracted one of the worst flus Id ever experienced in my life in fact Im pretty sure Ive never gotten any kind of flu before this one Im almost never sick I only fully recovered about a week or two ago and Ive noticed for the past few days a sharp pain on the top of my head everytime I cough or movechange elevation I figured it may be because Ive been sleeping a lot and not drinking enough water perhaps but I dont know I took a pain killer a few days ago for the same kind of headache but it didnt help Naps make it go away but not fully I can still feel some kind of pressurelight pain when coughing and moving Im also currently on my period which started a few days ago Not sure if theres any correlation Is this normal after a flu and a somewhat consistent cough I havent really gotten out of the house much the last couple of days either Maybe I should One notable thing in my medical history that I still have I believe is iron deficiency Not sure if that could also be a testament to whatever this is,Anxiety/Stress

I was stupid to believe going to the doctors would help I was stupid to believe medication would help I am still me No amount of medication or counselling will ever change that I do not know what my purpose is on this earth I cannot hold down a job No friends Most of my family cannot stand me I have felt this way from a young age and I am now 25 it is never ending I have never really reached out for help before but I was scared that I was getting close to ending my life it is all I was thinking of I am told I will have to wait two years for counselling The medication has done nothing but put two stone of weight on me so now I feel even more crap about myself I am in a dark hole and only I can pull myself out It gets harder to pull myself out each time I fall I wanted to try putting my thoughts out there instead of bottling them in like I always do To anyone else out there struggling you are not alone even though I know it feels like that sometimes you are not alonePS sorry if any of this is against the rules this is my first post Also sorry for bad grammar I never finished school because of this stupid disease I was stupid to believe it would help,Depression

Sudden Death at any Moment This is my first post on Reddit so I am unfamiliar with things work however I am here out of desperation Over a week ago I smoked a THC vape pen a concentrated form of THC I hadnt smoked weed in around a year and I generally do not like it I felt nothing for around 10 minutes then it all hit at once and I became very nauseous dizzy began to sweat profuseley and breathe heavily had a panic attack and had to sit down to avoid passing out I worried I was going to die I now know that it was a normal reaction to way too much THC called a greenout and I recovered from most of the symptoms after a few days However while greening out I felt a strange pressure under the skin of my forehead and apparently a red spot formed there temporarily Most of the symptoms went away However multiple times a day I feel a light pressure in my forehead still and a few days after that it spread to feel like it was behind my right eye too No pain just a light pressure that gets worse with exercise I also feel foggy and dizzy and have ear ringing commonly I am here because I have an anxiety disorder and have had major issues with health anxiety in the past especially a fear of aneurysms I forced myself to believe that my symptoms were a result of anxiety but when they didnt go away I went to the family doctor yesterday I explained things to the doctor and he wasnt sure what to make of it He said it was likely a tension headache but in his words wanted me to get a CT scan to make sure its nothing like an aneurysm though he highly doubted it That made my fears worse An aneurysm is one of my greatest fears Worse I have to live with this fear for another week because they cant get me a CT scan until the 12th The only thing preventing me from freaking out totally is the unlikelihood that I would develop one Im a generally healthy non smoking 21 year old male with no known family history of this on either side The symptoms while they are strange can seem like those of an aneurysm but theyre too unclear for me to be sure and could be a number of things I am keeping in mind my past experiences worrying about health anxiety that came to nothing but its hard to overcome my fears and symptoms This past week I have spent in constant anxiety and now Im too afraid to even walk up the stairs or drink tea or anything that might raise my blood pressure because it might rupture an aneurysm I think constantly about my own death and have trouble sleeping and eating I know this makes it worse but I dont know what to do Ive googled all this heavily I know another bad habit and I cant find any explanations as to whats wrong with me,Anxiety/Stress

Worried about tetanus Today I was tearing apart an old wooden desk There was one screw I was loosening and I reached out to pull the screw out when something pricked my pointing finger I immediately pulled my pointing finger away and went straight to the bathroom to disinfect it with hydrogen peroxide There was a small metal piece which had loosened from the screw and pricked me The wound is no larger than a pinprick and it had no notable bleeding Yet here I am worried about tetanus Please educate me or assure me that I am going to be just fine if you could I am driving myself crazy,Anxiety/Stress

Hey guys I am Pandora I am 23 and ohboy do I want to fuckin die I have been in constant competition with my siblings from the get go and no matter what I have done or try to do I am never getting any closer to getting any affection When I did speak up about how miserable I was when I was 17 because I was being bullied almost nonstop and had no friends my parents made fun of me for not being tough enough to make it in the worldStill did my best to please them for some reason so studied to become an architect and I was doing really well But I hate it I cannot stand any of it I hate the programs I hate the specifications I hate all my designs I hate working in the industry and now I have wasted 5 years of my life doing it Passions are practically gone along with any interests The only thing I can do to get any amount of selfsatisfaction is to let others degrade me which is pretty fucked up I really just wished I did have some courage so I could kill myself not to show my parents because it will just prove them right but because there is no point I have nothing apart from stupid attempts to make others proud So anyways that is the news I am not going to do it because I am a coward probably but feels good to vent Why keep living,Depression
I am losing a lot of friends Since I started therapy I realized that I am really vulnerable to be mentally abused by female friends I always had tons of female friends and I am losing them all in the shortest amount of time Some of them abuse me mentally and when I speak up they say fuck you and block me I lost 10 friends like that and everytime I meet someone new it happens again I am like a magnet to abusers They never physically abuse me or openly mentally abuse me Its little Chips in my mental health that they make bigger and then act like they did not knew it would happen I am on the shorter side and learned to love myself since I started therapy I still have my bad days and some of them told me things like tall men are really manly and so hot and I am not judging but they know that it hurts me and then act like they did not knew They always gaslight me to look like the dumbass that is deserved it when in reality I just want someone to talk to who does not think less of me just because i like feminine things Even worse is that I do look stereotypically masculine so they think even less of me when I do not have that manly side to me My best friend of 6 years who was like a soulmate broke up with her boyfriend and then told me I did not help her enough and that I am at fault that she nearly killed herself because I am a horrible human being and did not help her She was the last person left and if I wanted to vent or cry about something she was my goto place Before she blocked me she said she never met a bigger pussy then me and that its no wonder I am so fucking lonely When I told her that she only gets attention from dudes because she is hot but a mental health mess I am the bad one Its true tho She is a mess and nobody would want to be with her because she does not want to get help She gets attention because of her attractiveness and her body Then she blocked me and I do not have anybody left to vent to My therapist appointment would have been today but she is on vacation for 14 days and I have to wait for another week She said in extreme cases I should call her but I do not want to fuck up her vacation with her boyfriend I am losing a lot of friends,Suicidal

I just do not understand it I am nearing 30 and simple things such as finding a therapist or scheduling an appointment feel so completely out of reach like I am trying to chop down a tree with a tube of toothpaste I have been struggling with this for nearly 20 years now and have nothing to show for it I am still incredibly depressed I have no achievements I have held only a few fleeting minimumwage jobs throughout my life and never went to college A few years back I was going through a patch of being less depressed and signed up for Job Corps I wanted to make something of myself Well the depression came back As it always does Only this time my support network lived 30 minutes away My chance to make something of myself ended up with me in a mental health ward after trying to take my life because the pain and sadness just became unbearable Since then I have not recovered Every day is difficult I no longer have my parents insurance to cover my needs so I have not been able to afford seeing a therapist or getting medication for years I have no job no friends I am close to my family and they are the only reason I am not contemplating suicide right now I saw how much my attempt hurt them and refuse to put them through my selfish antics again Why cannot I beat this Why cannot I do the basic things people do every day like take care of themselves socialize with others and work a job Why must every little thing feel like I am trying to climb Mount Everest with a piano strapped to my backI am tired but I have no way out I am stuck with this burden whether I like it not but feel powerless to do anything about it Why does life have to be so hard,Depression
Feeling so incredibly overwhelmed this past week The past 89 months I have been so fucking depressed It began with moving to a new city hoping it would be a new start and a change of pace But ever since I have moved I have felt isolated like I have never felt before I do not understand the people in this new city The job that got me to move has been unbearably frustrating and has some what put a hold on me life How I do not even know I do not have friends or family here I have never been so isolated in a crowd of people I do not even enjoy been up during the day And the worst issue is I do not know how to talk to my family about things that are stressing me out The rage frustration and loneliness is all bottled up inside and I do not know how to deal with it The one thing I could always rely on to help with my depression is the main thing causing my depression Honestly do not know how to deal with it anymore If anyone has suggests that would be greatly appreciated cannot seem to catch a break,Depression

Well ever since I was a toddler my parents never got along well The hardest part was when I had to choose sides Currently I live with my little brother and mother When I was younger I chose sides with my father since he was a little less strict Because of that my mother holds a lot of hatred against me She insulted me since I was 5 when my father was not around And in the past 2 years ever since Covid started She started taking Work From Home My mother and I never got along well mostly because I am a tomboy and my she bought a lot of tricks and girly dresses and a very few tshirts So I tend to only wear the tshirts but my neighbours kid who is a girl loves girly stuff so most of the time my mother wishes I was not her daughter And also as I earlier stated that she hated me and the reason for that As my mother started insulting me about that I am dumb since I am a girl etc I went kind of crazy Until one day I could not take it anymore and screamed I know that was bad of me but I could not control myself this time And to top things off my brother behaves like a literal baby even though he is not one Which usually gets me into trouble And fun fact if my brother does the same mistake as me my mother is more kind to him compared to me And I currently have a bad relationship with my father and I do not have anyone who I can go to And I think my mother has a weird obsession if making me look bad in front of people by telling them my day to day mistakes But no ones perfect My mental state has gone to the thought of me killing myself I have tried to but my dreams get in the way I like singing so when I mentioned earlier that I screamed it was pretty loud since my voice went high because I have been practicing a few songs Now a days I do not like interacting with many people I only opened up to 2 people in this lifetime and neither of my parents are included in the list of those 2 people My mother makes me feel worthless and tries to make me feel bad about being a girl I do not know what to do with life anymore it all seems hopeless Needed to open up,Suicidal

I know the title for this post is strange but this is truly how I feel and have been feeling for a while now I suffer from severe depression and anxiety I also have OCD and autism so it makes my life a little bit harder than normal Through all of the struggles and dark times I have I cannot stop thinking about how much I want someone anyone to just hold me in their arms and give me a long hug It probably would not help in the long term but it would just be a temporary relief for me with the way I am feeling For someone to just hug me for a minute would make so much of a difference you would not believe but unfortunately I do not have anyone around me right now who could do that and it really really sucks Like I said I would not just be permanently healed from this but it would be a temporary fix at least Sorry for this weird post but I just wanted to vent a little Thanks for reading I think a hug would make me feel better,Depression

no matter what I do my wife thinks I am cheating on her I travel for work so I can cheat I work in town because it is easier to cheat I leave to cool off after a fight and it is to go cheat An X contacted me about a computer issue and again to share a news article about some Politian Maybe I should have ignored them but at no point did I think about cheating on my wife with my X But she is convinced otherwise I have never cheated on her or any other relationship in my life EVER But her X cheated on her so I must be doing it too I have given up my regular job my friends my band and members of my family it is not enough Social media deletion has been an ongoing demand that she is currently winning 700 friends gone from Facebook Twitter is deleted and I am sure others are comingConstant reviews of my phone is now a thing Text call logs voicemail app usage what have you But I must deleted everything before she looks because NOT doing anything adulterous is not an option Now she is expecting a baby as it seems that her tubal ligation has repaired itself after eleven years She informed me that she has left and will not come back to me and out house Hiding herself and unborn child from me I told her goodbye tonight and that she will not have to worry about seeing me again or interfering with the life of our child Is accused me of cheating I have the phone called recorded because it literally feels she does not care ampx200BI am not here asking for help just documenting my plan and to answer the question WHYI am also aware that plenty will point out that is she claims I am cheating without proof she is probably the one cheating Maybe yes maybe no I know I would rather die than for that to be true what other option do I have,Suicidal

i m 0 and i m alone and it s tough to pretend i m a whole person amp x 00b i haven t made a friend since high school i m starting to befriend someone at work but it s giving me a lot of anxiety because when am i going to say the thing that make her hate me it feel like i have to do everything right to be social or maybe i m missing something that everyone else ha or maybe i m just not cut out to be social but to have friend you have to answer them when they fucking text regardless of what s going on in my life and i just don t have the energy to keep up with that i recently had someone tell me i wa probably not doing well on bumble bff because i m a slow responder sometimes i don t know what to say sometimes word aren t happening in my brain sometimes i m just too tired maybe missing out on social thing for all of my 0 s is something i m never going to be able to recover from amp x 00b i ve been in a lot of workplace where i wa the loser i had no friend i d catch people saying mean thing about me they all get together with each other and i m not invited i ve been in multiple situation where group of people don t like me and do shitty passive aggressive thing to me every chance they get i don t know what i do wrong i try to just be a genuine kind person i get feedback that i m nice i know i m not perfect but at least i ve had some feedback that i m not totally delusional to think i m a nice person but there have also been a few time where i know what i said there have been a few time when i can pinpoint the off comment that make someone turn on me and it must be more than one off comment because it s always easy for that person to get a group to turn on me it s terrifying to feel like at any moment i can slip up and someone will just decide i m not worth their time amp x 00b and i never feel like i say the right thing some of my coworker s response are lackluster think lol and i just wonder if she even want to talk to me making friend give me the same anxiety that trying to date someone give me that s kind of fucked up i should probably not care so much whether or not someone decides they want to be my friend but also it affect me i feel like i m not worthy of friendship because so many people have decided i m not worth their time and honestly this is a big moment for me because this is the moment i realize i ve internalized all that rejection and got to where i don t feel good enough for friendship why would someone pick me when i m a ball of nerve why would someone want to hang out with someone who only feel like half a person amp x 00b lately i ve been doing okay relative to the last 0 year i finally got a job that doesn t feel like chinese water torture i m on medication and that help a ton i m a lot better about not letting myself slip into negative thought pattern this week i haven t been feeling the overwhelming cloud of misery because i finally got medication that isn t expired and i m taking it regularly but every time i think about social stuff it just give me this squished feeling i can t name the feeling but it s visceral my body feel shitty i m going on a vacation with my mom and her work friend in a month and i m so fucking nervous because what if i do the thing that make everyone hate me i don t even know what the fucking thing is but spending four day with people who are talking crap about you in a small space i did that around this time last year and it wa so bad amp x 00b okay amp x 00b i m a solution oriented person and part of my problem is that i don t know how to fix this part of my life i don t really know what the solution is to feeling unworthy of friendship it took me eight year to figure out the solution to hating myself and honestly even though it s a struggle it s also worth it to fight through those feeling and find an even timbre social situation are just approached totally differently from a mental health perspective i ve googled how to feel le lonely and the fucking answer wa make friend how do you make friend when you feel like nobody want to be your friend and for good reason therapist have basically told me to find a group and the friendship will happen naturally but there s not a huge meet up scene in my area and i have a ton of anxiety about going to one and the few i have been to were not great i couldn t read the book on how to influence people and never feel powerless again i got halfway through it and it honestly felt like customer service kiss as bullshit but this time i m not even getting paid for it that book make me feel like i have to scrub my personality clean and poke myself into a small box to be socially acceptable amp x 00b i just don t know i m going to keep trying different thing i m going to keep putting myself out there because the only other choice is to keep doing thing the same shitty way with the same shitty outcome amp x 00b i needed this rant today and if anyone actually manages to read all that thanks for your time and i hope both our day get better,Depression

I feel like I have always had one sided friendships like I am always the one who puts in all the work And it sucks because it used to hurt less When I was a kid before I moved for the first time friendships were easy My best friend lived a few houses down and wed have sleepovers all the time we did not have phones so we would talk and hangout during recess and on the weekends and then I moved and I was the weird new kid it took me three years to make friends and just when I started to fit in we moved again and again I was the weird new kid I would somehow find my way into friend groups that were already established but because they would known each other forever they never included me in anything because I was not really one of them I bounced around friend groups for 3 years until I met the new weird girl we bonded over how shitty moving was and we made fast friends we are still best friends more than 10 years later we made our own friend group and it was nice but she graduated 2 years before I did and the year after she left my friend group changed we took in two freshman that seemed to hate me for no other reason than I was the defacto leader they thought they were hot shit and gossiped and lied and turned my friends against me except one and I was okay I had other friends and spent time on the sidelines in their friend groups but then they all graduated or moved and it was just me and a school full of people who either hated me or did not know I existed I was facing senior year alone and with the worst schedule I had ever seen a senior have so I dropped out cut off all my hair attended the local community college to get my GED kept my head down mostly did not really make friends after I got my GED I kept taking classes nothing in particular just general stuff edged my way into more friend groups again they never made plans with me but I was used to it I did my own thing and I was ok I had a job then and a semi decent boyfriend I wasted two years in college and never got enough credits to even really count as half a year dropped out lost all my school friends when I stopped going to school worked and spent time with my boyfriend life was good I had my best friend who hung out with me all the time a good job and a semi decent boyfriend and then we broke up and my parents moved so I moved in with a man twice my age in a state id never been to and he went to work in Alaska left me alone in a house with four animals to look after a job that gave me four hours a week and a freezer full of burritos i made one friend that was a good friend kept me company when I needed it washed my dishes if I made him food took me out places he was probably the only reason I am still alive then the man who is house I lived in came back I somehow managed to get back with my ex in that time and I moved with my parents to another state id never been in the friend who would saved me stopped texting stopped responding after six months of no friends and no job I moved back to my hometown to be with my boyfriend who kicked me out in less than a month so I lived with my sister and her two kids husband and fil slept on a cot in my nieces room eventually broke up with my boyfriend worked too many hours in a job that sucked and did not have time or money to make friends in a desperate move I moved in with a new partner to a different state this one I would at least visited I got a job we had nice roommates everything was nice until my partner had a mental breakdown moved out left me alone where I could not afford the rent so I moved across the country back to my parents where I live still I have been here for two years no job a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and one friend that never reaches out if I do not reach out first never wants to spend time with me unless I ask and suddenly I am back in middle school a depressed fuck with no real friends no motivation and a the biggest wish to have never existed in the first place shitty friends are the worst I do not even try anymore I do not want to try anymore I want to fade into the background until no one remembers I ever existed If you are reading this know that I do not want to die I do not want to stop living my death would be too painful to people I care about I would never do that to them but if a genie came to me and gave me one wish I would ask to have never been born obviously there is a lot more going on that fuels my depression but this is the most prevalent right now Rant Down in my feels tonight it is a long one,Depression

I have been having a very difficult 8 months in all the ways possible and had been contemplating taking my life for basically the entire time it is not something I have really talked to many people about and had been working to see a therapist as soon as possible but have been having issues thanks to insurance I kept telling myself if I feel this way in 3 months then I will look into my options to end the pain And 3 months came and went and I still felt that way 6 months passed and I would find myself laying in my bed with tears in my eyes watching the latest news of how humanity is destroying itself and wishing I was not alive 8 months went by in a depressive fog and I continued trying to give myself hope for a future with very little luck It has felt like despite trying to do everything right nothing has gone right or even slightly in my favor This morning I felt the urge to end my life stronger than I have felt in my adult life In a puddle of tears contemplating how to take my life I asked myself what am I even living for anymore And my phone rang My phone ID showed the caller was my beloved sister who I have not talked to in months I could not bring myself to tell her my mental struggles but hearing her voice saved me And without knowing what I was going through she delivered the words I needed to hear most She gave me hope again when I felt it was all but lost From one sad heart to another PLEASE do not give up hope The people who love you would miss you more than could be put into words I know this bc I have survived many suicides in my life and each one hurt in ways I still have not been able to fully process It may feel rough today tomorrow and possibly for years to come But it does get better Just remind yourself that you can do hard things even if the hard thing is an internal battle with yourself But if you give up that fight you do not end the pain you just gift the pain to anyone who has ever loved youMy only advice is do not struggle alone it makes everything so much harder Call someone anyone you know that cares call a crisis hotline write an anonymous post go do something you love try something new but especially treat yourself with kindness You are not required to be happy every second of every day of your life You are human and the human experience is a messy one So be messy love do not lose hope,Suicidal
Worried about lymph node but it also may just be a ingrown hair cyst I think its been there for awhile but I could be wrong I just know Ive fixated on it this past week Its located right above my right testicle and it feels hard and doesnt move its probably between 12cm and I cant tell if its a cyst as the hair there does look a little red by the root Ive now convinced myself I have cancer or HIV and feel awful I did set up my physical for next week but some aide to my anxiety in the the mean time would help Ive had fatigue lately but im always kinda fatigued due to my autoimmune disease,Anxiety/Stress
StressInduced Diverticulitis Curious if anyone else here has suffered diverticulitis as I am currently on my 5th flareup and my doctor is recommending surgery evaluation since its happened to many times I have been under a ridiculous amount of stress lately at work not that it is a contest and I decided to research if stress was a factor with diverticulitis Turns out it apparently can be so now Im trying to find better ways to deal with my stress in hopes that it will help resolve this problem without surgery My primary form of stress relief since last year has been freestyle BMX I have found after a particularly stressing day just going out there and hitting the skatepark or practicing new tricks really helps alot Leading up to this latest incident I also was unable to ride for 2 weeks due to my bike being repaired so that got me thinking about stress or if its coincidental that this happened again after I had no stress outlet for 2 weeks I need to channel my inner Matthew McConaughey,Anxiety/Stress

AI and the devaluation of humanity Ive been thinking a lot about AI recently The explosion of ChatGPT Midjourney DALLE2someone with zero writing or art skills can spend 3 seconds coming up with a prompt and generate something incredible Something a human would spend hours or even days coming up with And its accelerating faster than we could have imagined AI voice spoofing AI generated images of celebrities and politicians plagiarized college essaysthese things were unimaginable 6 months ago All this gives me anxiety and not just because Im a writer as my profession Its devaluing human talent and creativity everyone can now do it therefore it means nothing Oversaturation renders everything meaningless And the irony is that humans made this tech that is now outshining all of usand will ultimately do everything better than we can This is a pivotal time in humanity and I am not ready for it and I dont think anyone is really ready for it Everything from the way we work to the way we consume media will be completely upended by AI I just want to rewind 20 years and live peacefully I dont want all this change And its filling me with anxiety hopelessness and dread,Anxiety/Stress

A couple months ago I hurt one of my closest friends with words that I did not mean a single word of I lashed out But even so that just makes me all the worse of a person that I let out my anger and frustrations upon my peers like thatI have alienated myself from the people that have actually made me happy in my joke of a life And the moment I have been kicked out of some of my peers lives things start to drastically improve for them Its like I was hindering their happiness this whole timeThe worst part of all of this is that I did this to myself I am responsible for the way I am Its my own fault that I am an asshole a jerk an absolute pathetic loserA day does not go by without a passing thought about ending my own life Forgiveness and redemption are futile at this point for me I feel like I am better off not being in anyones life,Suicidal

I am 23 male from Iran I have had a crazy life like mom diying in car accident when I was 4 Abusive psycho dad Being raised by my narcissist strict grandparents I have had no life None No rights no hobby no freetime no social interaction Was just forced to study 247 to become a doctor My grandparents would not even let me to groom my hair properly or wear perfumes because that would attract girls I had never met or talked to a girl for my intire life till I was in university and that obviously turned out terrible I have so many personality issues and find it hard to properly socialize with anyone I got into med school in another city expecting to finally start living a normal life and having my basic rights All those promises my family had made that they would finally let me be free or the things they are going to get me if I get into med school but suddenly my rich narc family stopped paying for my basic needs like even enough to buy proper food Or to pay for my taxi Let alone hanging out with friends or getting a girlfriend They said money will spoil you You will get busy with girls and not finish your studies I wanted to take my driving license and they replied the same I tolerated that hellish situation for 4 months but after that quit It was not that easy they still arguefight with me to this day 2 years have gone by and I am stuck in my room with nothing much to do but making the days pass 247 on my phone or watching movies I soon realized being a garbage collectorconstruction worker in a free country free of Islam and theocracy is better than being a doctor or even specialist in this hellhole of Iran I realized through the online friends I made that I am not the problem The Islamic system is I could easily connect with people and even girls not only romantically but on a human level and make true connection but here the restrictions and rules have made our girls kind of weird and too hard to catch Like until 2 or 3 years ago being caught just walking with your girlfriend on the street would have ended up with 100 lashes and execution in the 4th trial Iran is like a big cemetary we are not allowed to singdance or date it is like happiness is forbidden walking on the streets is like there is dust of death everywhere So depressing and things are getting even worse like drought And our currency devaluing day by day Right now the value of one USD equals 25 Toman My dad is a selfish piece of shit that lives in another country but I do not count him as dad and do not want to have to do anything with him My grandma finally gave me 10k for a language course abroad in Europe but I need atleast 15k for my whole application and visa process Idk what to do with 10k My alternative plan is to make it to Turkey get a cheap boat and sail to Greece with the hope of getting sunked midway I hate my life,Suicidal

I am filled with envy pride and resentment I will start of by saying that I may or may not be suffering from depression Ever since I turned 21 I started feeling jelous towards my peers profesionally academically relationship wise I am 27 now and things havent really improved Everytime I try to share these emotions with someone namely my mother she just brushed them off and made no big deal out of them Telling me to just man up basically When I shared them with friends they either said nothing or told me to get over it as such I bottle these feelings because it seems to be a nuisance to other people Fucking assholes I feel envy profesionally because I do not work in the places I wish to work and for positions I want to work at I am underpaid working a job I have grown out of for years Relationship wise I barely have any friends anymore after college No partners due to me not taking the initiative to do so Not due to lack of confidence but due to constant daydreaming and fantasizing about being in a relationship instead of actually pursuing it I do not feel like an independent person up till recently I was living with my parents and just now am learning to live on my own I wanted this to be sooner but due to my own lack of initiative and financial struggles I was not able to I have been addicted to pornography and videogames ever since I was a teen Just now I am trying to fix these issues But its hard man really hard after 15 years of constant use Makes me feel disgusting Full of hatred But at any inconvinience or struggle I immediately resort to these two things Lately I have been suffering from mood swings from manic anger and anxiety to relative peace serenity and reflection Within the same hour even I have also seemed to garner small panic attacks at the most ridiculous and inconsequential things that happen to me I talk to myself Alot Alot alot over the years For about a couple years now this self talk has turnt more negative over time Insulting my own capability and intelligence at any mistake There have also been timesin which I contemplated suicide but not seriously Just the idea of ending it all has crossed my mind I dont really know why I wrote this I guess I also have been feeling lonely,Depression

Once upon a time I am pretty sure most of us had a relationship that has left you broken huh A relationship is super overwhelming all the time the constant fear that your significant other will leave you They will leave you unfortunately I learned it the hard way and I am sure others here had devastating relationships worse than a bomb dropping harder than Hiroshima Once you hear the words I am breaking up with you you know damn fucking well you should have stuck with the drugs and alcohol until you see the afterlife If you do not want to get hurt please do not listen to your instincts about how the boygirl you have met at school is going to be the perfect soulmate There are better things to do with your life if you are single think about all the freedom you have instead of all the bullshit you have to deal with your girlfriend telling you you should give me more love and affection instead of hanging with your damn friends or your boyfriend telling you do not dress like that to impress other boys or I am going to get pissed at you Fuck all of that bullshit do not get blindsided by the fact that you are going to enter a whole other world of devastation coming your way There is no perfect person for you nor for anyone in this universe sad but true What the hell is the point of having a damn worthless relationship They will end up being horrible flashbacks anyway,Depression
I know this question might sound odd but when does therapy usually start helping I have been in therapy for over a year now and I am with my second therapist already I started therapy because I did not feel well most of the time I could not concentrate and I barely ate anything I got diagnosed with depression after a month maybe and I got some medication too but since then I did not gain anything from therapyThe medication seems to help a bit because I am having less terrible nights but at the same time therapy does not seem to helpI go there talk about my last week and we start trying to figure out where my bad moods came from but we never find out and at this point I am questening therapy eventhough every doctor told me that therapy is the most important thingOf course I will continue therapy but it is starting to feel more like a burden to get out of my house and get on the bus for 30mins only to have the same meaningless conversation every weekMy mother is worried because I still barely eat and I have been underweight for a while but I just want to feel better I want to get rid of all these negative thoughts and find something that is worth living forI just want my life to be less painful When does therapy usually start helping I am not sure if it is even worth going there anymore,Depression

I mean why Well you will die anyway someday why you could die now if you want Why it is considered bad and insane In the past in japan for example it was a normal thing to commit suicide to remove shame of yourself and even honourable It is ok to kill yourself this day too for some kind of protest Then why you cannot kill yourself just for nothing Even if you are not suffering much Just like i do not know as a form of shame Like i just do not understand why is it that big deal All humans will die anyway someday what does it matter if you die some years earlier or later All times it was ok to have honourable death Let me have it I just see it now optimistically and not negatively Like you fuck up you die I do not know how to describe it but i see it now very optimistically Like i do not suffer that much but still want to die for all things i fucked up I see it as relief as a salvation from all fuck ups I know i will sound like a kid but it feels so cool for me Like the same feeling when you watch a movie with a tough good guy as a main character who even when he is tough he has his code like do not kill children do not stab in the back give a chance do defend himself etc Like those codes seems cool This thing feels like a code for me too so that is why it feels cool too Why is it bad to kill yourself,Suicidal

Recent onset of HA Trying to nip it in the bud Hi all Back in November I had a rather large health scare I had a real symptom that I was dealing with for 2 years I thought it was just something simple so I kept putting it off I never had HA before and was so laid back I let this issue go on for 2 years Finally saw a doc about it and immediately was ordered a CT scan I got afraid it was serious Went in for the scan and had to wait 12 days to get the results back since it was over Thanksgiving I was not myself these days Pretty much mortified as I was finally coming to terms with my mortality wishing I went earlier etc Thankfully to SO MUCH RELIEF the scans came back clean The issue I had was very real however Docs knocked it up to a really bad cold I had that did some damage on my body Annoying but manageable Thankfully not the big C or a brain tumor I am healthy Since then however Ive been shook Its been some time now but since Ive had more HA than I ever had before My family line is healthy Im relatively healthy etc However Ive been over analyzing myself and have thus far induced two issues The main one being overnoticing my eye floaters and oddities I had my whole life that I literally never had before Eye things seem to be the big thing right now with me I dont know I DONT have visual snow but am afraid if I think about it too much I might get it I have an eye exam scheduled soon I was due for a standard one anyway but I dont know why my mind is in something is wrong with your eye mode when my eyes have been like this my whole life And I have had many normal exams I really want to nip this in the bud before it gets too bad I think its still young and I can overcome it and beat it before it consumes my life I need to Im looking for self help methods right now Guides meditations even books Please do not suggest therapy at this time It is something I may consider in the future but I am not in the right place or mindset for it right now Had a traumatic experience with it in the past I need therapy for my therapy Ha But any advice on selfhelp that I can do right now would be really appreciated Ive been listening to positive affirmations on youtube which has helped a lot I think I can get over this I just need direction Thank you so much,Anxiety/Stress

I see these people portrayed on the silver screen die Die when they want nothing more than to live I see that and wish to myself it could be me who does instead I imagine all the fears and worries I would never have to face again All the monotony boredom pain suffering all of it gone Return to the dark the void nothingness Home The good things in life are a pittance to pay to escape the horrors of life The humiliation that accompanies it If only a quick death was so forthcoming in the real world it is somewhat odd how I simultaneously see the deaths of others as a tragedy and my own as a freedom as an escape from punishment Whenever I watch movies I wish I could take the place of characters who die,Suicidal

Thinking of deferring law school due to mental health and burn out Really need advice and support Hey all For context Im 17F and in week 4 of 1L so have just started law school However these past three years but specifically last year was so hard on me On top of enormous pressure and performing at a ridiculous standard in high school to get into law my grandpa who had been battling with a brain tumour died 3 days before my first exam These exams were the ones that dictated whether or not Id get into university For some background my grandpa was like my father to me When I was younger especially my dad wasnt home often as he was constantly working as a lawyer and would get home really late so I wouldnt see him As a result my grandparents looked after me and I spent countless hours with them and still see my grandma every week As you can imagine his death was possibly the most devastating thing for me Seeing someone so articulate and intelligent being unable to move nor speak to you was so hard but I had to push it all aside and after burying him in the ground I went into school no literally 30 minutes after the burial I had to go to school for final exam prep Anyways this was in November of 2022 I got through exams and for the first time in what felt like forever I felt happy at Christmas My mind was clear I was surrounded by family and didnt have any responsibilities I even managed to stop anti depressants for my anxiety which had been bad from 20202022 but especially ramped up in the period of his deaths to the point where I got through my days with whiskey and beta blockers So I had a brief intermission of calm I was happy for about 3 weeks till about February this year until it all came rushing back Anxiety panic attacks derealization Just like that put back on 10 mg of lexapro which Ive been on for just under 4 weeks The trigger Possibly University Being back in an educational context with such high stakes and workload such as law may have caused this relapse But I decided Id push through and have one to uni these past four weeks with the help of beta blockers Its been probably one of the most difficult weeks since my grandpa died Exhaustion unable to leave the house without terrible anxiety and just loss of ability to enjoy anything Ive spoke to my therapist and he thinks I need a break from study and need some time to actually relax and process to allow my body o heal Besides the mental strain Ive been under theres also been physical and health issues Ive been dealing with being hyperthyroidism and as of a week ago iron deficiency Seems like my body wants me to stop but I dont want to Studying gives me a sense of purpose of validation I guess all I ask for is for some advice please This is a big decision for me and I really just want someone to talk to and hear me Thank you in advance,Anxiety/Stress

I ask you from the bottom of my heart to help me Ps The whole essence of the problem is in the second paragraph the first paragraph is about me I am 18 years old I have a weak nervous system from birth but a strong character and because of three years of serious problems in life the death of several close people my nervous system has failed and I probably have chronic anxietyFrom below I will describe everything that I have tried if you have something to say I beg on my knees help me I tried meditation for 40 minutes a day breathing techniques and much more of this type but I came to the conclusion that this is not a solution to the problem but a group control of my mind I have tried a very large number of different herbs ashwagandha sacred basilAlso different supplements taking longer than 1 month and zero results at most it became a little easier but it is almost imperceptiblePersonally I think that these herbs supplements are mostly utter nonsense which has a lot of side effects stupid studies that were not conducted in real life or just made to promote the product I tried using reishi mushroom cbd oil from a proven brand tried vaping and other ways of using and everything is even Please do not recommend medications or any herbs of the kava type which has a hundred side effects it is better to die than to eat this shitIf you really know a magic supplement herb or something else about which few people know and it HELPED YOU OR YOUR FRIEND ACQUAINTANCE tell it to me please please please please please please please please Do not think that I am the type of people who have tried 1 product and immediately gave up I am a person who ALWAYS GOES TO the END and will never accept defeatI really spent a hundred hours analyzing this topic for the most part and 99 of all the information is just a stinky slag bitch and its impossible to fucking find adequate informationI searched in YouTube in different languages also in Google itself for different queries in different languages on Twitter and Facebook and found nothing workingIf you have read this minipost thank you so much for at least thinking about the possible help to a strangerAll the best to you,Anxiety/Stress

In the animal kingdom animals are vital healthy fit and I am going to this creates the neurochemistry of happinessthere is the beauty of life the happiness the joy and also there is the brutal aspect of itI think that the brutal aspect is completely interrelated an interdependable with the bright side of lifeThe fact that animals are left to forage their food by their own makes them move their body they evolved for it they do sports without intending to do so its just their movement We designed a world in which we have to use our will to exercise when its much easier if its part of our livesAlso we expect things from others these puts us in a very odd position animals in nature do not expect anything from anyone they cannot whine about life to someone so they solve their problems therefore they do not feel victimized and all that shitThis brutality is what keeps the balance and believe me when the balance is off suffering begins to creep in in the beginning as simply something that bothers and in the long run it can be unbearable painI think that just like animals die in nature prematurely humans should have some sort of filter I think that we should not stigmatize death we should see how it really is something that shapes the world and makes it better in a way I think that we should not fear death like a prey running from it nor chase life to the very end as if we were a proud lion chasing prestige we should be the intelligent beings that we are and simply feel nothing neither abhor death nor adore life we should simply see death as an option a viable option like abortion but with extra steps and due process We have to conceive a reality where parting from this life is a normal thing I think many people would do it if it was not stigmatized and much suffering be relieved There are reasons to celebrate death and lament life its not always the other way round Life can get very painful to the point that dying really could be an option,Suicidal

Think Before You Post why reassurance seeking might be feeding your health anxiety Hey rhealthanxiety Just thought Id make a post detailing my personal experience and knowledge about reassurance seeking and why it is self destructive So youre experiencing your symptom that youre increasingly more worried about Whether that be chest pains heart palpitations stomach problems poop problems any of the hundreds of symptoms any of us could possibly be worried about Youre worried about if this is the time where your worrying is justified or if it is actually a sign of the illness youre fearing Maybe youve already been to the doctor to get checked out but doubt their opinion All of these have happened to me and happen to many many other HA sufferers which is completely okay However the way you deal with it is paramount to your recovery Usually what I would do is post here explaining my symptoms and what I was worried it was Then Id get some replies reassuring me and maybe feel better for a bit Or Id ask a close friend or family member and get the same results All of this felt like what I had to do a huge compulsion to do this just to know that I was fine In the short term yes it made me feel better but this was only short lived This might also account for medical tests Ive spoken to many people who have previously thought that getting that MRI or CT colonoscopy or endoscopy or whatever it might be would make all their worries go away Which after the short term relief the anxiety came back This is so important to understand and grasp to begin recovering from health anxiety I speak from experience One of the biggest things in recovery is how you deal with these thoughts and need for reassurance Possibly even the key to fixing your health anxiety So if you dont seek that reassurance whats going to happen For me at first it was unbareable anxiety and just an extreme desire to check I was okay whether that was through posting to the subreddit the discord asking family checking my body for lumps checking my lymph nodes etc Youll most likely experience increased anxiety whilst not seeking the reassurance you want which is completely okay Rather than seeking reassurance do something mindful something genuinely healthy for the mind As when in a very high anxiety situation sometimes its the things that you do during that time that really define how your mental wellbeing will go in the future You can do many things for me it was taking myself away from what I was doing and spending 10 minutes trying to immerse or distract myself within something else not an easy task by any means but something to try After the 10 minutes was up I would come back to what I was doing and try to revert my thoughts away from my worry which most times the anxiety had passed and I didnt need to seek further reassurance You could possibly try meditation though if you dont regularly practice it itll be very difficult to do under high anxiety levels You could try relaxing music your favourite food anything else that enhances your mood whatever works for you During this time you will experience anxiety potentially more during that time of not seeking the reassurance but I promise you in the long run it is going to do wonderful things compared to getting the reassurance and feeding the problem When you seek reassurance youre reinforcing the behaviours which keep your health anxiety alive unfortunately because usually it feels like the right thing and the only thing to do in that situation But trust me try not seeking it Itll be very similar to this graphhttpsthegirlwiththecurlyhaircoukwpcontentuploads201512anxietyrepeatedexposuregraphpng the more you do it the easier itll be And it might get to the point where the anxiety almost completely goes after a while of practicing this Seriously it is worth definitely giving a go and thinking about this if youre currently having a lot of anxiety Ive been there hundreds of times and applying this mentality was one of the key turning points into recovering from health anxiety,Anxiety/Stress

Help for when your anxiety turns physical Ive had panic attacks and such but one thing thats a bit more off and on is how anxiety affects my stomach When I had daily stomach pains in elementary school that were unexplained it now makes sense that it was definitely anxiety brewing Im going through a period right now where my stomach is just revolting against me I have the urge to go just about all day every day and will sometimes go 24 times a day when my usual is once a day plus its now usually loose which wasnt an issue before The only thing Ive found to kind of help is Tazo Zen tea It does ease the stomach upset a bit but I also cant drink THAT much of it before making myself nauseouseven more sick How does everyone deal with this in terms of their anxiety I only have this issue on weekdays when I have work Im usually normal on weekends so its obviously the anxiety I just feel tortured by my stomach right now I also meditate which only helps for me while Im actually doing it so the anxiety comes right back as soon as I open my work computer basically Anything soothing for the stomach would be great although I will say I am currently dieting wedding in June and trying to stick to lowpoint foodsdrinks on WW,Anxiety/Stress

Sorry if this whole post is a mess my mind is a huge mess atm Anybody out there who grew up without proper adult supervision or is currently doing so Man if you are I have deep respect for you and you deserve nothing but the best in life I live this way too and it is the worst I am currently 15 years old and I have been living without proper adult supervision for nearly 3 years People might think living with no house rules no discipline no anything might be the best but it is nothing like that for me Basically I live with a lazy cousin who does almost nothing else but play games and shit even though he is 22 And my guardians who are supposed to be taking care of me are miles away from the house I live in For the past couple of years I have been raising my own self aside from financial support which I am thankful for but it is not enough pretty much trying to figure everything out all alone Before this all happened to me I had a pretty normal life wherein I was kind of dependent on my parents on everything But I mean cmon parents are there to give children what they need time love and their basic needs you know So moving onto this kind of lifestyle after I lost my parents was really tough I had to deal with mourning their loss moving into a new city school home changing my lifestyle completely and leaving my friends my old house all behind altogether And I was pretty much alone throughout all of it because nobody my age could understand how I felt and my guardians who are supposed to be looking out for me kind of always just leave me alone Sure it might not be the hardest thing ever for some people but it really has been for me Fast forward to nearly 3 years of living this kind of life it is only gotten worse The house I live in is always under heavy neglect because of my failure to keep up with all the chores and my cousin literally not helping but just adding to the mess The dishes always pile up we seldomly take out the trash so that piles up too there are so many containers in the fridge with unfinished food that has been there for several months the back area is infested with insects and snails parts of our rooves are leaking our gardens are ridiculously overgrown and were always late on restocking groceries etc I could keep going on and it just gets worse and worse To add to that we do not eat healthy foods and only eat 12 times a day we just eat processed foods or fast foods plus we do not get any exercise either Our lives are disgusting and I really wish I had the strength to persevere and change our lives but it is been so tough being in all of this alone I always try to initiate changing our lives but every time I do so hoping I would motivate my cousin to help me he does not help me He still stays lazy while I try and fix our lives and it really takes a huge toll on me and always affects my progress because I just wish he would help Lately I have been dealing with so much more to the point I have nearly attempted to leave the world for good several times I thought I just rather be with my mom now This is because my aunt who lives halfway across the world decided that I was going to get two puppies do not get me wrong I love dogs so much but they are not suitable for the kind of lifestyle I have right now And now I feel so overwhelmed with how untidy and messy our house is but the dogs are already here I feel so bad for them I feel like they deserve a much better home And it is also been a struggle to take care of them personally Because I feel like I am failing them and not providing everything they need they are both big breed dogs which I have never had so everything with them is a new experience for me I feel like I am not giving them the proper lifestyle they need so it is been so stressful Plus again as expected my cousin is not helping He does not even at least pet them or play with them you know And it hurts me so much I live in a middle to upperclass town but my life is pretty close to how people in poverty live or even worse because at least some of them still manage to have fun and have loving families This place is the most depressing place I have ever seen and lately I have just realized how emotionally neglected I am it is been nearly 3 years since my mom passed away but I have not even gotten close to moving on The thought of her being gone has been and still is so heartbreaking and always brings me to tears And nobody in my family has bothered to sit down with me and ask me how I am doing or how I am coping it is just been so dead in the house I live in especially for the past year and a half in quarantine My cousin and I barely talk unless we go outside to run errands He just stays in his room all day and does not bother helping out with the house I swear to god I have contemplated just going away for good so many times This fucking life is horrible and I want to escape so badly and be with my mom in heaven The only thing that is stopping me now are my dogs I love them too much now to leave them behind knowing that they might not be taken care of properly So I really am trying my best to muster up the strength to fix my life without the feeling of needing my cousin to be as productive as me But I just find it so hard depression just does that to you I guess I just wish things get better and I wish I continue to fight for myself and my dogs Ps I am not really looking for pity we all have our own tough challenges in our lives and this is my battle to fight I would absolutely appreciate it though if those with the same experiences comment down below and let me know how you managed to get out of it and get better Or at least what you do to cope I am 15 and I have been realizing how emotionally neglected Iam by my family,Depression

Internally induced vs externally induced depression This is a pretty ignorant question but is there a distinction between internally induced and externally induced depression For instance internally would be those cases where your neurochemicals just betray you youre moving through life just fine then suddenly youre bedridden with catatonic depression and only after being heavily medicated can you function Externally would be a concatenation of failures or disappointments or miseries which blacken your view of humanity and existence itself to the point that you no longer see the good in people or the joy in experiences and eventually an reach a point where youre also dysfunctional and need to be medicated Has anyone experienced the former,Depression

I have been depressed for a really long time essentially the majority of my life In the midst of my current depressive episode I just notice how far back it actually goes and I have gotten 9 or 10 out of 16 years I have been living with this I want to have a future I want to have kids and a start a family when I am older be successful etc I do not think I can do any of that if I am depressed at random Every depressive episode can be triggered by even a mild inconvenience My depression is only getting worse Every year I lose the will to live more and more Its been so long and I will need alot of therapy to get over it but that is the difficult part By the time I can afford therapy I am scared it will be too late My parents know about my problems but they ignore it They know about the self harming the suicidal thoughts a rough idea of how long I have been depressed etc and they do not believe its bad I have asked for therapy multiple times and its been dismissed Working a part time job that will allow me to afford therapy in college is iffy affording therapy fresh out of college is iffy whether or not I will ever be able to afford therapy is iffy I see people on tv in books in the news online even on subreddits like these with children and they constantly express how depressed they are and whether or not they can live for their children I do not want that to be me I do not want to grow up never getting the help I need and when I do someday have children they lose their mother to suicide Or even worse they grow up with a mother who is depression affects her ability to parent and she ends up lashing out at her children or being incapable of taking care of them the way they need all the timeI want to try to heal in my life and I know I cannot do it alone or even with support from loved ones I know to heal I am going to need professional help but I do not know if that is attainable Healing before I can really live my life,Depression

People talk about the morality of killing yourself of the pain you leave behind for those that love you They talk about religious implications and of the pain of different methods of suicide They talk about the regret of not being able to achieve your goals in life if you are dead as if my ten year plan would matter at all to my corpse But none of that is why I am still here positive or negative it does not inform my decision I am here because of the terror of waking up in the hospital the morning after my attempt at self harm The fear that in by trying to end the pain of life I will make my situation that much worse Unable to use my hands because I slashed through my tendons Unable to speak or control simple motor functions because of the brain damage from lack of oxygen Paralyzed or comatose or with a giant crater in my head from a bullet that just could not quite get the job done Did you know that suicide by shooting yourself in the head only has an 82 chance of succeeding Scariest fact I have learned in a while Fear of Failure that is what is keeping me on my feet today But there is always tomorrow Fear of failure,Suicidal
I dont know if people normally feel this way I try to care about people but I really dont and I dont understand why I cant Like Ive never actually felt bad for anyone but obviously I still act like I do and I realized that most people usually care Like if they were gone I wouldnt care and if they got injured or anything Id just shrug it off instead of worrying When something happens to me most people show sympathy and it just makes me think if theyre being genuine Maybe its because Im not good with emotions Oridk Im emotionally unavailable Does thinking this way make me a bad person Also most of the time when Im in a convo as a group I dont really feel any emotional connection or it just feels empty and everything I do is just an act Anyone else feel this way,Depression

Support and advice greatly needed 26 year old female sorry for the long post Ive been on anti depressants for about the last 12 years of my life I was always on 100 mg zoloft amp then switched to 20 mg lexapro in 2018 but went off of them for about 6 months in 2021 to try to live without them At the end of those 6 months I started to get dizzy more often amp have what I can only describe as uncontrollable thoughts Not suicidal or thoughts of harming anyone but I just did not feel in control of my emotions and I felt like I was gonna lose my mind lol amp very depressed So I got back on lexapro 20 mg amp after a few months I started to feel average at best but better than before August 2022 I started to get brain zapsdizziness every day for over a month so I went to a new psychiatrist and got back on Zoloft 50 mg to start I worked my way up to 75mg amp started to feel a lottttt better but in December my dad died and I was extremely close to him so that obviously set me back I went up to 100 mg around Feb 2023 and have been having issues ever since Very dizzy lots of anxiety amp panic attacks and the weird uncontrollable emotionsthoughts and always feeling on the brink of a panic attack have been happening since It gets A LOT worse at night and thats when most of my issues arise Within the last 6 months Ive seen an ear doctor to make sure I didnt have inner ear issues causing dizziness an eye exam I got a small prescription mostly for being on my phonecomputer or reading and I got an MRI done and saw a neurologist All has always come back normal so Im thinking its a medication issue or lack of something Im mostly looking for advice or comfort to make me feel better since Im not doing well lol Thanks for reading,Depression

Distrust of doctors and diagnoses how to overcome Ive had quite severe health anxiety for a few years Its hopped from one malady to another and medical counseltests do not assuage it as Im always convinced theyve missed something Most recently its cancer at first lymphoma now cancer in general Ive visited specialists GPs had chest xrays and bloodwork and finally a full CT scan with contrast Despite the all clear in each instance I spend a debilitating amount of energy on the anxiety theyve missed something Each diagnostic procedure seems to buy me a few weeks of calm before the terror and doubt returns I do not have systemic symptoms of cancer and am in apparent good health save mild diagnosed GERD but compulsive googleing assures me many healthy people in their early 30s are diagnosed with terminal cancer out of the blue after numerous misdiagnoses etc That GERD must be stomach cancer the lymph node that swelled after a dental infection must be lymphoma the doctors are brushing me off the medical system in Korea is inadequate the medical system in Australia is inadequate Ive carried this pattern through the doctors offices of three nations I recognize the compulsive and anxious biases Im operating on here but I dont know how to change them For those who have endured something similar how do you learn to trust the doctors all clear How do you trust that you would probably show some obvious symptoms in case of serious illness and those symptoms would be correctly interpreted Im feeling exhausted and hopeless from the unending cycle of costly medical tests which produce little effect on my anxiety Your advice is appreciated,Anxiety/Stress

I am so tiredI know in my heart I can fight this I have done this a million times before But for what A few brisk moments where I can lie to myself and pretend it is all okay But it is not I am not okayI do not want to fight anymore It never changes anyway Nothing gets better I do not think it ever will Whenever I try to fix things they only end up in a worse state than when I began One of the things I regret is when I do nothing I vowed to protect them The little angels who brought me a sliver of hope when I was at my lowest The ones who gave me a reason to continue on in this cruel world of pain and torment But I lied As it turns out my promises are nothing but empty words and lies I tried so hard at first but no matter what I did it was never enough I am just too scared she is going to hurt me and they have to pay the price It pains me to know that they are going to grow up the same way as I did just because I am too much of a coward to do anythingYet another thing that has gone wrong because of me I just hope I can help ease the pain as much as possible so they do not end up as much of a pitiful excuse for a human being as meIts not getting better Its never going to is it I am going to be 15 soon That is If I stay alive for long enough to see that day I used to tell myself that they needed me It would be selfish to leave them again I am still so guilty about the first time I left them I wonder how many times they cried for me And all because I was too selfish to stay But they coped last time They do not need me One thing I do not get is why everyone still just blames him do not they see My other siblings do not remember Nobody remembers Nobody knows I am left to carry the burden of the past all on my own it is not like I could forget after all I remember every word every bruise every tear I remember everything I remember the pain and the sorrow and the hope for the future I remember it all that is the only thing that is really changed I guessThere is no hopeThey make out she was the victim He stabbed her in the heart and left her for dead while she was the heroine who save the day and soldiered on for her children What a load of bullshit I know the truth I was there and I watched it The images are ingrained in my memory the truth like a bullet lodged in my skull They were both as bad as eachother a fiendish pair She is not innocent I remember when she held me down and made him record me as I screamed and cried and begged her to stop restraining me as they put it All I did was talk back All I did was get upset All I did I remember when she threatened to post the footage of me screaming and crying on social media if I did not do as she said Blackmail was one of their favorite forms of punishment I REMEMBER IT ALL I remember when I was three and he held me against the wall by neck shouting in my face the stench of alcohol on his breath overwhelming I remember when I told her I was going to kill myself and she called me a coward and told me to wait until the morning because she was too tired and there was nothing she could do yet when her perfect princess said she was feeling depressed she took her up the hospital I REMEMBER WHEN THEY BOTH SAT THERE AND IGNORED EVERYTHING MY SISTER DONE EVERY WORD SHE SAID EVERY BRUISE SHE GAVE ME I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS FIVE AND I CAME DOWNSTAIRS IN TEARS BECAUSE BOTH OF MY SIBLINGS WERE BULLYING ME AND SHE JUST TOLD ME TO BE HER BIG BRAVE GIRL INSTEAD OF ADRESSING THE ISSUES I REMEMBER I REMEMBER AND OH HOW I WISH I COULD FORGET ALL I WANTED WAS FOR THEM TO LOVE ME WHAT DID I DO WRONG WHAT DID I DOI am sorry about that It just hurts to know that after all of that they get off scot free and I am left in the dust scrambling around trying to find the pieces of myself that they tore up and scattered in the wind It hurts when they talk about how brave my sister is and how she had it so much worse than us because she was the oldest How it is all my dads fault My sister has a boyfriend who loves her and a generous following on social media She has money She could not be happier My mother met her dream guy they are about to get married Where does that leave me I think you can guess If I was in the same place they were I would not be going to reddit to write all of this I would not need to they have done so much more and caused so much damage and it hurts to know that all I ever did was try to be good All I ever wanted was to be nice I did everything they told me to do I tried so hard So why am I stuck here and they get their perfect lives What did I do wrongIf you read this please help me Tell me where I went wrong so I can fix it Please All I ever wanted was to be happy The weight of the past,Depression

Over 12 years ago I M had bad anxiety with random panic attacks Depression was mixed in there as well probably due to the anxiety they went hand in hand I went to therapy and a psychiatrist I was put on lexapro and the panc attacks stopped I have since moved far away from those doctors have not been to therapy in years I just kept taking lexapro from my primary because why not No one ever said to stop But in the past year or two my concentration has been getting worse and I felt other random little physical side effects from the medicine had just become annoying and thought why not stop lexapro it is been years I had to stop taking it before at one point due to moving and finding new doctor so I knew about withdrawals and I had to stop another couole prescriptions before lexapro was the one I slowly lowered my dose every week or two for about a month or so Eventually I stopped and of course physical withdrawals came on brain zaps and all I stopped 4 weeks ago and the zaps stopped about a week ago I have been less tired in the mornings which was a big struggle on lexapro always tired I have been overall feeling myself But I am still having some mental things I am still finding myself having random moments of depression Just feeling hopelessness and thinking about the things I enjoy as a waste of time I try to just work through it and tell myself it is temporary thinking it could be the medication adjustment The other weird thing is since I stopped the lexapro I have had odd sexual side effects Like decreased sensation weaker orgasm not lasting as long etc I have never had this on lexapro only one I stopped completely This is starting to bother me and I am thinking there is some permanent problem from 10 years of lexaproMy main thing is what do I do now Is this still normal adjustments from coming off lexapro or an SSRI in general I am not having panic attacks or bad anxiety which is why I took it years ago in the first place Do I talk to a primary first Should I try therapy Go back on medication Or go to a psychiatrist first The problem is I have really crap insurance that only covers psychiatry and therapy through MD Live and I see mixed reviews on that so I keep getting put off from trying it Also not sure if a therapist or psyciatrist is who I should talk to about thisMaybe someone out here went through something similar I feel like I started with anxiety years ago and ended up with new problems and depression Not sure what to do next,Depression
I have daydreamed about suicide every day since I was 12 I started getting depressed at way younger than that but I would say the fantasies started around middle school Back when I was in school I would zone out in class and make all Fs because I was constantly daydreaming It went all through middle and high school and now that I am an adult with a job I do it at work to Imagining the goriest death for myself All throughout my youth I would use chatrooms and forums dedicated to people planning to commit suicide I really thought I would not make it to 16 but here I am at 21 Ending my own life is the only real dream or goal I have ever consistently had What am I waiting on How old am I supposed to be when I do it I just hope its not much longer What am I waiting for,Suicidal

I finally went to see a psychotherapist after years of struggling and the conversation was really nice I mean it was quite basic he asked me if I wanted to talk freely or if he should ask away and I chose the latter but still even just talking to someone who is nonjudgmental and not so reactive towards possibly disturbing things I might say was liberating Right at the start I told him I was suffering from depression but after talking for just a bit he quickly crossed thatpossibility out saying that I did not have the most prominent symptoms being lack of sleep most importantly among other things Apparantly sleeping well and too much is a disqualifier lol In the end he did diagnose me with a reoccurent depressive disorder I dunno if that is the correct term in English on paper even though he said I am just fatigued so I am confused However the main thing I wanted to say is that I just do not know how I feel about this if I count on his words and not the final diagnosis I should feel relieved but if I am not depressed what makes me the mess I am What makes me apathetic and hurt for no apparent reason I cannot shoulder the responsibilty for failing in life so far yet it is too much without the excuse of being depressed To top it this was my biggest fear ever since I suspected I might be depressed in my teenage years That I might just be this way that everything I was going through was just me my personality I finally embraced and accepted that I was depressed years along the way and often realized just how fucked up my mind is when others reacted strongly to random small things I said seeing in what dark place my mind was Maybe I am just lazy and cannot grow the fuck up I should have asked him if he was clearly diagnosing me with depression or what Or is there a difference I do not know about He also said that I should meet with a specialist for gastroenterology for my iron deficiency and emphasized that many women apparently suffer from the kind of symptoms I do just from the deficiency I have experienced severe anemia before and I have had barely acceptable iron stats for years although I do take supplements whenever it dips too low and have that checked every year which my doctor for that does not take it half as serious Anyway even though I came out confused I rode the high of having achieved seeking help which I have been putting off for ages And as I said before just talking openly was really nice and I feel like I got lucky to actually like the first professional I met with having heard that many need to switch a few times before finding someone they click with Even though I cannot go back there as there are no capacities in my city for the demand there is apparently Please go seek therapy if you need it Everybody can benefit from it not just us depressed folks So yeah if anybody actually read this far have a nice daynight I wish you well Just me rambling about my experience in one first therapy session,Depression

this is the 4th silent breakdown i got from the span of 5 hours I tried to dismiss the pang in my throat bc i did not want my family to notice I am on the verge of crying I may have joked a lot of times about being the first one to die Idk maybe i am an asshole for being interested in my familys reaction once they see me in my deathbed I do not know my mental state since I am not financially independent to go secretly get myself a shrink so here i am in suicide watch writing this post I have been feeling depressed for the last 5 years i suddenly get upset and have this pain in my throat that really hurts I tried opening up to my parents that my tendencies of suicidal ideation had tremendously increased especially this year But unfortunately they are the type that does not believe in such illnesses and only brand them as made up stuffs for people that are seeking attention I tried to open up but in return they just said I am copying my bestfriend my bestfriend was diagnosed with major depressive disorder along with BPD and i easily let the demons fester inside of me bc i do not go to church that much anymore Maybe they do have a point but I am still uncertain i cannot go selfdiagnose since I am not a professional and maybe I am also overreacting But there are times where i really want to end it right there and there but I am too much of a coward to hurt myself so rather i tend to distract myself by either researching on painless death or just indulge in fictional literatures Maybe i do not want to die maybe i just want to disappear for a while because everything suddenly feels overwhelming and it is exhausting and hurting at the same time I want to open up to my friend but i do not want to bother them knowing they have their scars too maybe even deeper than mine I have been trying to distract myself it is what I have been doing for the past 5 years During the first year i just sleep it all off whenever i notice these dangerous thoughts randomly popping up but then suddenly they became more enticing more louder the fact that i cannot sleep so in return i tried to find a new way which is indulging myself into the fictional world But now it seems it keeps getting worse the more i try to ignore them maybe 5 years is my limit I managed to keep my wrist clean but now I have been trying to slice it although the minute i notice I am doing it i immediately back off Whenever my parents nag about my slothful behavior i keep getting reminded of the awful threats I have thrown to them making me feel guilty and even feel more like a piece of shit When they told me I am just copying my mentally ill bestfriend just to garner attention it felt like they pushed a button I spouted nonsense angrily and even threatened them that I would really kill myself And then it felt like they were mocking me knowing those were just empty words and i do not have the courage to do it In addition they also guilt trip me that i will not be able to spend my time in heaven with them since I will be rotting in hell Because of that the thoughts of killing myself just to tell them see ma pa i could do it multiplied I feel guilty for thinking this way because despite them being ignorant about mental health they never lacked in other aspects I know they care a lot about me in their own ways that is they were always trying to provide me mh needs The audacity i have to tell them such hurtful words adds up to the guilt that has been keeping me up at night Maybe I am just being a brat Idk I am just really tired i want to start all over again I have been thinking of killing myself on the 6th of september i probably back out again knowing I am a coward Maybe that is a good thing i do not even have the courage to slit my wrist maybe i really am just an attention seeker but if there is one thing i know i know my feelings are true and not certainly made up this is so messy and my grammar is terrible but thanks for letting me post this mindlessly typing until my throat does not hurt anymore,Suicidal

Pointless living and nothing will get better Im 32M and have been dealing nonfixable problems for a long time Ive seen that extended family is pretty much an arseholes and theres a tipping point where my life changed because of that At the end of Uni i realised one thing i feel like i picked a wrong subject Thats the time that i realised that working in IT back in my birth country i wont achieve anything or can afford anything by myself At the same time i realised and considered my existence in this life I feel nobody could hear my voice nobody cares and so on Graduated i ended up couldnt find a job for years Literally years I had only two jobs one for 6 months and another for 1 month I never and even up until today feel proud that i worked there I feel like its just necessity to do something for moneyliving Thats from i graduated in 20122013 to 2018 Years of sending CVs and interviews none of them stick around During that 56 years another major event happened to me and my parents I realised that working in family is a BIG RED WARNING because how they can treat you bad since youre Family Thats what happened to my dad He lost his job because he and my mom tried to give a reasonable opinion towards my Uncles son their nephew Huge debate and my parents ended up losing the job That moment is a tipping point for me I had huge anxiety issue and major depression I went deep down the rabbit hole and i have no point of living anymore Until i got an opportunity to move country by myself for study and got a job in IT industry For a slight moment i feel better in my life but it went and still goes back to my depression ampx200B From here this is the present problem that i have Due to losing a job from his brother and being an older people in my country my dad doesnt have any income at all I have to support them just for the sake being a son should help their parents or anything about Family should support each other Due to my depression i got a suggestion from counsellor that helping people might help me slowly Oh boy its a very very wrong advice I ended up losing lots and lots of money helping someone just to get on their feet and still didnt help I cant even afford to rent place House pricing is ridiculous that includes living cost crisis that happened anywhere around the world Having flatmates is a nightmare I even tried to sacrifice what i do regularly so they can have things they want like quieter place have their freedom etc But all of them back to the reason why i created this post Im tired living like this This issue never ends and the only solution is pretty much having enough or lots of money People just dont care what ive been through and nobody wants to help me as well Family friends all of them are just arseholes Sometimes i wish theyre gone Like literally gone or die My parents and everybody else in this world If it doesnt allow i just wish im dead Never wake up anymore in the morning I already wish the same thing every night I feel done and im actually done both physically and mentally Stress feeling sick all the time i sleep through the weekend and still feeling tired i have no friends and nobody Losing money means i have money problem as well and nothings good anymore in my life I have made peace with death Living is a thing that scared me the most,Depression

Its true that I can probably be annoying messy absentminded so I forgetlose things a lot Im also always making possibly annoying jokes about everything and afraid that comes off as attentionseeking or something but I dont really have any evidence that I was bothering anyone In fact it seemed like we were all having a great time But Im having a hard time shaking my worry that I acted like an idiot or something I felt the same way after going to my favorite cousins wedding last year who I also hadnt seen in a couple years tldr does anyone else feel reasonably comfortable in social situations as they occur but then torture yourself over them after they have come to pass,Anxiety/Stress
Sorry guys I gotta take a thoughts n feelings dump right here So I literally dont talk to anyone anymore Super depressed going about my days I would be dead such a long time ago if it wasnt for the weirdest most pathetic thing ever The first person and basically only time Ive been truly in love I doubt well ever hang out again let alone end up together But I love her so much still so many years later that even that 000002 chance of feeling us hold each other is just enough to get through another day Im 32 now And its been over ten years since Ive had that feeling and experience But out of all my ups and downs and insane experiences traumatic shit everything She gives me the feeling I need to just get through things Days Sometimes down to the minutes and seconds Her life is normal and fulfilling and pretty nice if you ask me I doubt she thinks of me and Im not a strung out piece of shit like I was years back anymore but no matter how normal my life looks now a days its so empty and its always felt empty without the feeling she gave me so long ago I feel like such a pathetic loser for holding onto this love for so long without reciprocation without telling her and with it having been the only reason Ive ever got through how terrible I had my life in the past Ill probably die with that secret someday too but I just wanted to put it somewhere out into the universe Even if its just here on Reddit That Ive had this feeling Ive held onto that Ive embedded into the fiber of my being so that I take it everywhere Ill ever go and its the why to every breath I unconsciously take I dont expect this to mean anything to any of you But theres love in the world that no darkness can bring down no drug could compare no words can describe and no time can erase and I hope that you find it and if youve had it and lost it as I have may you live with that small hope you feel when you reminisce,Depression

Long story short I have always overslept no matter when I get to bed Most of the time its because my half awake brain stops the alarm and its game over from there Even when I wake up from the alarm I can be 5 minutes late from sitting in bed too long I do not what else I can change even if I had a later start time I think the same thing would happen Bc I can literally sleep for 20 hrs I have had understanding managers and coworkers in the past but it always comes to the point where their understanding can only go so far Looking for any help to stop this pattern or to help managers understand I am not irresponsiblejust depressed Thank you Chronic oversleeping due to depression leaves me consistently inconsistent and late to work Advice Help me advocate for myself Is it wild to think accommodations could be made,Depression
I had anxiety since age 11 and ruined childhood because of that I had derealization and crazy anxiety attacks where I cried I had no idea what was happening and could not really tell my parents what was wrong Dad was an alcoholic but a happy type of drinker mom worked very very hard and got hooked on pills and occasional alcohol We lived in a house with my grandparents that I loved very much My mother made go to different school at 10 that I hated It was further away teachers sucked and schoolmates made it clear they do not like outsiders I had a friend there that was most hated in my class therefore I was unpopular too My dream was to leave that hell and study electronics 5 years of torture left But to be honest last two years were much better I got a PC and had something to talk about with others and also realized that so called friend was a liar and manipulated me My mother did not want me to study electronics but chose another school instead I was broken I suffered from stomach issues and puked every morning Classmates and friends were great though The anxiety went away and depression started The derealization was mostly gone but the depression kicked in and I started to loose interest in my hobbies what is happening I do not know maybe I am just sad that I am fat So I lost weight No that was not it and no my mother said I look horrible because I am skinny I was always something I her eyes You do not go out you play too much you read too much other kids speak 7 languages they have good grades they do sport Depression destroyed my concetration and my ability to learn At age 18 I had my first suicide thought I was like What the hell are you even thinking aboutI wanted to become a detective so I went to law school and lasted 3 months My world crumbled Now what I was unemployed for months and parents hated me because I was a disgrace I found a corporate job with help of my sisters husband I lasted 3 days Back to school I guess I had no interest in math so tech schools were out of the question I applied for social work and finished it Somewhere in the middle I got an idea I will learn math and apply for IT school and that is what I did I worked hard whole summer Then first semester started and I almost went crazy It was hard to concentrate and I felt like my whole reputation depended on this I will show everyone I am not dumb and lazy just a depressed lost fuck I got a bachelors degree and realized corporate world is hell In my new job I lasted three weeks before I got fired They saw my complete lack of interest My father told me I am a dickhead and I am a lost because I wanted to jump out of the 10th floor I still had people to live for Dad died shortly after and my sister gave me a contact on her colleague that worked in IT withing the police in my city They were looking for IT guys I got the job I was really happy I am still happy for the last 35 years My sister tells me that without her I would accomplish nothing and she Is the only reason I have that job This kills my self esteem They sister and her husband are succesful and have money and they make fun of me for being a looser with no girlfriend I never had a girlfriend My only girlfriend is and escort that I visit every two weeks She was one of the reason I never killed myself We really like each other and are good friends I started with medication two years ago and it was the best decision I discovered I am bipolar just like my mother but I have less serious version of it Sport helped me and also a little discomfort Try to go out If you hate places with lots of people and loud music that is great Do it Your brain needs to get used to these stimuli If you hate your job there is a chance you hate your city too and maybe your whole social circle Just move to a smaller city and start over that is my last resort if everything fails Just do not fucking kill yourself YOU WILL GET YOUR ENEMIES HAPPY AND THEY WIN YOU WILL GET YOUR ENEMIES HAPPY AND THEY WIN,Suicidal

I have been depressed for a long time The biggest difference between my depression in the past and how I feel currently is that I no longer have any hope that one day things will be different I use to think that if I made change that my life would turn around and I would crawl out of depression and find happiness Maybe that idea was always unrealistic but I no longer have any belief that I will make it out the pit of depression Instead I feel condemned to be like this for the rest of my life and I cannot comprehend how I am supposed to do that Like I said I have simply given up hope I have given up hope of ever being happy,Depression

Im so lost I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember Even when I was young I wasnt really happy Anyway I was diagnosed in my early twenties I have learned how to live with depression how to alleviate it etc I havent really been to therapy a lot for several reasons Lately I dont have the energy for most things I can barely make it through the day I have deadlines and things to do and I really really want to get out of this vicious cycle and get better But every now and then I completely lose hope I dont really want to die because despite everything I maintain my optimism that things can and will change But in the meantime how am I supposed to function to get there Change only happens with actions I dont have the energy Ive lost all motivation My main problem these days is whats the point I see whats going on in the world and everything is going to shit People are fake as fuck The only things that matter to society are extremely superficial I dont understand how people function in this society Its probably also helpful to mention that my home life is an epic disaster I had to move in with my parents because I dont work currently thank you depression and for the past year and a half they have been in a preseparation mode that they wont conclude I think that both of them are narcissists who ultimately only care about themselves My mom holds me responsible for her marriage and she has played the victim her whole life My dad is a narcissistic liar who wont deal with the truth My siblings are pretty toxic and I am the one that they all depend on for emotional support The thing no one is really there for me Anyway This was a rant I needed to let out because I dont really have anyone to vent to I dont want to burden my boyfriend with my depression he doesnt deal well with it I dont want to tell my friend about this because they have their own problems and we barely ever get to talk they all live abroad I rarely meet people who understand me Can anyone relate to my story,Depression

Is it really meant for anyone Anyone but the richest of the rich or those who have control over people If you have enough control you can convince anyone of anything you can make them question their reality and their life who they are and their own morals Honestly I think part of me died in 2016 I always think about that year and how awful it was Getting evicted with my mother my ex friend dating someone twice her age and getting mad at me when I said that it was weird memes turning from silly cats and animations to compilations of people getting made fun of for things they have no control over Sure maybe some of that shit existed before then but man was that a fucked up year and I have never felt personal peace since I think it was the year my childhood got wrecked I had to enter reality hard and fast and I have never been able to heal from it since I do not think I belong in this world I do not think its worth living in Honestly once the internet became a necessity the world has taken a nose dive in my eyes I wish we could live without it again I wish we were not so dependent I wish every word action and thought I put out was not recorded I want to hide my past self and forget my trauma I want to be a new person But the idea of any info any thing I said when I was young or anything I shared that was private can now be possibly shared with anyone I feel like I am not worthy of this world I am one of the scum that is selfish and needy I can never live a normal life again I cannot keep things in the past because everyone will always want to find out I want to kill myself for the sake of the planet one less body to deal with one less worthless soul to hear beg for mercy This might be the most annoying post I have ever made in the way that is like I am so smart way but man I truly am upset with how humanity functions why cannot we live like dogs or something were we do not come up with stupid meaningless bullshit to attach worth too This world is not meant for me,Suicidal

Since I have memories I have always been bullied but that is not the worst part My mom it is a narcissistic and manipulative woman who always jokes about my self harm and say things like I could put you in the streets or saying she will be happy without me my dad it is just so in love with her so he does not give a fuck about what she does I have tried to kill myself twice but it did not work My therapist has told me to off myself and saying that I am not depressed saying I am lazy because I cannot clean my room nor my teeth Sorry for the bad English it is not my first language I am a 15 years old female who do not know what to do,Depression

Hey guys I need advice on a situation that has plagued most of life Let me explain people do not like me in short and I do not know what to do Let me tell you the entire story and no I are not fishing for sympathy it is actually a problem I want to find a solution too It began in elementary school the other kids did not like me I am a tall person and so I was never physically bullied but the kids would form groups and ostracize me They would talk behind my back and I barely had friends most people rejected me I still get haunting nightmares about it disturbing moments that happened to me For instance soccer was big and all the guys played together but when the teams were chosen I was not even last pick I would be standing there and everyone would get picked and they would start without any team choosing me I would go back and forth trying to figure out which team I was on everyday and they would tell me go to the other team and the other team would say go to the other team And if I stuck with just one team and played everyone would just start getting angry Every guy in our grade would be playing soccer or some sport every day and I would get excluded No one ever passed me the ball and slowly I got into the game playing as a goalie I was a good one but people hated meI am a smart guy always have been even in elementary school and there were people like me too so intelligence could not be the problem They hated me before that and we are talking about a grade of over 50 kids I never said anything I was like any other kid and it was not racial because we were all of the same race nor was it about how I looked or what I wore I was always dressed well and hygienic I started to get this idea that people thought I was boring although I like having fun I used to ask my parents why people did not like me and they could never answer me Furthermore I left elementary school behind and went to a high school in a completely different area so barely anyone from my elementary school went to my high school It was a complete new start But people did not like me I was ostracized and excluded for no apparent reason and I try to blame myself but I cannot figure it out Aside from school my home life is fine My grades were amazing and still are and I am humble about them and never brag because no one is dumb I am humble and other people like my Taekwondo instructor said that about me But I am ignored People did not like me in high school so I just stuck to academics and going to the gym At the end of the day I would lay in bed thinking why people do not like me Again I dressed well I am nice according to others respectful stand up and reliable and intelligent You know I thought maybe two different pools of people would result in something different but not only rejected by various different groups but my own cousins reject me They never invite me or do anything with me We are of the same age but they ignore me as wellI feel like a loser I have hated myself for years and still do All throughout elementary school and high school people talked behind my back and made fun of me I have been used by people but I end up thinking you know maybe not this time Even after I put my foot down no one likes me Whatever I do I end up getting rejected However I managed to make a small group of friends who rarely every invite me anywhere They post snaps and go out but rarely invite me After years of this I feel numb I cannot feel the feeling of hollowness I once used to thinking about why they never invite me out The memories they make will be there forever but I am in the cold I have stopped feeling things I have laid in bet countless nights since elementary school I am in university now thinking about why people ignore me or forget me My sister seems to have a great time making friends and being liked by my cousins and she is younger It also goes without saying that I have never been a hit with the ladies although I am constantly working on myself for years Trying to learn interaction with people and working on my body I have never been too skinny or overweight so that cannot be the reason either I am in post secondary but people do not interact I am alone again I have never went to a party or done anything I am boring ugly and a plain loser and that is not fishing but just what my mind has just gotten accustomed too I do not know what course of action to take I am lost my only defining quality in my head is how smart I am academically I still have traumatic flashbacks things that trigger me like when someone calls me stupid or a loser My mind completely explodes although I hide it I have this rage in my when someone hits a trigger and I am a low tempered person I rarely get angry but triggers set me off but again I hide it from people and just bottle everything up Sometimes I feel like I am going insane my head fumes up and heats up and I start getting angry I know its wrong but seeing other people who have done such bad things having a good life bothers me it enrages me I have done everything and even now I am alone bottled up in myself I need advice please I have been struggling and need someone to give me some support,Depression
Worried after burning nonstick pan I was heating up a nonstick frying pan earlier and left it on high for about 10 minutes after forgetting about it It started smoking I realized what was going on and I grabbed the pan and ran it under water I turned on a fan and went about my business for another 10 minutes in the slightly smokey room Suddenly I became anxious and looked up if this could be harmful and found several articles about something called polymer fever I definitely have a bit of a scratchy throat and feel kind of weird but I dont know if Im just imagining it,Anxiety/Stress

We have not spoken for months because my depression made me act too dependent and downright mean sometimes We agreed it was in our best interests to freeze the friendship for a while until I got betterAt multiple occassions because I impulsively made contact anyways he assured me now was not the time but there would be a time in the future for us to catchup and start over as it were During all this I still did not get better My depression got way worse and I got heavily suicidalToday it has been almost 4 months since my last small impulsive message and about 8 or 9 months since we stopped propely talking and I found out he blocked me on Instagram and Facebook our main ways of communication I checked with dummy accounts to see if I was really blocked or just doomthinking but I am blocked He already stopped following on Spotify a few months ago and at the same time removed me as his Insta follower but this is a whole new stepI know how pathetic it is but this really makes me want to end it all I care so much about him and he does not care about me seemingly He ends our friendship in secret by blocking me It might even have happened 3 months ago I only just found out by investigating myself I apparently have not even earned enough respect and love to get a message If he does not care about me then no one does My sense of selfworth is so rooted in others loving me and I cannot handle this right now just found out my best friend blocked me everywhere,Suicidal

I am staying in my parents house for the summer since I have just graduated college I have an industrial engineering degree I am supposed to start work at what I am told is a very good job in September It was a very competitive position and to my everlasting shame I outcompeted a great number of people far more dedicated and motivated than myself simply because they did not possess the same talent for education and testing I ought to have pursued something more mediocre to begin with or maybe nothing at all given that I will be a rotting corpse by September either way What a wasteI have moved my dads Glock 19 from his dresser into mine and I doubt that he will notice its missing before the gunshot Right now the sole object of my life consists in building up the courage to point it towards my head Once I am able to do that I assume the act of pulling the trigger will be relatively easy To my mind overcoming the subconscious instinct of survival by an act of conscious will might be the single most significant act of individuality it is possible for a person to undertake that is probably not true but I believe it anyway since it provides an air of dignity to what is fundamentally a cowardly and disgusting action And if I am doing it either way what difference does it make whether I dignify it or torture myself by calling it what it is I have grown tired of torturing myself Although the recognition of this logical inconsistency is really self torture in its own rightI am sure my suicide will seem absolutely ridiculous to everyone I know My life appears to be going perfectly I just visited a good friend of mine in another state for a week and in that entire time did not tell him anything of these feelings I have not told my family either or any of my other friends I just cannot stand the thought of them actually trying to help me actually trying to be there for me and comfort me The thought of their empathy makes me sick to my stomach They really have nothing to offer me and if they did try to help me I would have to pretend that they actually were to avoid hurting them more The last time someone gave me the old useless platitudes of things will get better and people love you I wanted to laugh in his face but instead I pretended that those words had helped me for his sake That moment was nothing but a reminder of how wide the gap is between me and every other living person how alone I really amAlone that is the root of all this I could stomach all my uncertainty my nihilism my cynicism the tangled unnatural unworkable psychological web I am trapped in if there were a single living human being who could understand it Could understand me With whom I could share some common ground even one idea or way of thinking But there is not I think I am probably insane Some undiagnosed mental illness runs in my family and drove my grandfather and great grandfather to paranoia delusion reclusively and violence later in their lives Your response to my concern here will be to tell me to see a psychiatrist or therapist since that suggestion is in vogue on this website right now Well I have seen them Two different therapists I even tried to be honest with them And the response the ideas and suggestions they gave me were so asinine so off base so completely missing the point that I almost could not believe it I felt insulted I doubt there is any help for me in the field of mental health any more than there was for cancer patients in the days of HippocratesI do not know why the hell I wrote any of this it is either a cry for help or an attempt to put something of myself into words for others to see before I cease to exist non omnis moriar Either way I have nothing else to say On My Approaching Death,Suicidal

Firstly I apologize for the tldr and if this is not formatted properly I recall the exact day of my first panic attack being diagnosed as bipolar followed not long after maybe a couple weeks Has anyone had extended periods of anxiety I mean like waking feeling as tho your gut is being torn apart kind of anxiety and for it not develop into depression This could be the beginning stages I am sure and it could also be my mind just being a dick head I have been trying to stay off medications and the options in my area with the limited insurance I have leave me extremely limited for options as far as therapists go One place is telling me it could be 23 months but another is saying they could start seeing me within a couple weeks The obvious solution you would think would be the latter option However this place 2 different therapists absolutely failed me to the point of it nearly killing me Due to my insurance being cancelled and me having nobody to help me and the medications Mostly Lithium causing me to go absolutely blank my ability to feel was completely gone I apologize if this is all over the place but I am becoming more and more worried which ofc is causing more and more anxiety I understand that medications are sometimes needed especially in conjunction with a suitable therapist but if I were to go through all that again there is no possible way I would come out alive not again As much as I appreciate how much empathy it caused me to develop feeling nothing was probably the closest I could imagine being sent to a literal hell You all surely know the story but my family all but abandoned me at my absolute worst To this day I do not speak to most of them probably 95 I would like to go on but I am working on not falling into the infnite abyss that is usually my explanations What I want most of all is to be able to get my focus back again What I want least of all is to admit myself into a hospital Tho I do also understand there is a point in which it may be the only option but I am not ready for that option at this point in my life I have been off meds for about 6 years and I was desperately trying to be strong enough to withstand the torment enough to perhaps trigger something within me to move beyond it Question It has been a while since I broke free from depression,Depression

This is probably going to come off as a messy bunch of writing but I have been in this weird state of just a lack of desire to keep living for a little while now I am just getting up and going to work 5 days a week to do fuck all most weekends i do not know how I am going to keep that up for another 40 odd years its felt like my life has just been get up and go and I do not know why I am doing this anymore its not even a sadness most of the time I often want to end my life not out of depression but out of what could only be described as a curiosity as to what is after death right now I am in a particularly bad space right now which is what brought me here idk I just felt like I needed to ventexpress myself to anything other than myself I am just so tired I looked at my reflection in a mirror today and saw dark bags under my eyes I am so damn tired physically mentally emotionally I am tired of lifes endless cycle I am not looking for reassurance that things will get better honestly the chances of me killing myself are quite low but the thought of ending it all have been persistent for a while now and I need somewhere I could get all this somewhere other than just in my head All I need is for one person to see this,Suicidal
I live with my family and I have just gone quiet I do not talk much about anything because the thoughts on my head do not make for good conversation I have stopped taking to a lot of people last year bc i felt they were not good friends for me and i was right i just do not have other friends to talk to I do have one tho i game with but i have trouble talking about feelings with him too I do not want advice when i talk to someone i guess that is why i do not I do not want to be told to get out more and talk to strangers because i do not know how to do that Or join clubs bc i already know that is a good way to meet people but I am just discouraged the people i really like move away and we lose touch and i do not like that many types of people I just constantly listen to podcasts to fill the time when I am working on stuff but myself or gaming I always feel like an outsider and i think being alone most of the time is making me worse at making friends I do not even know what to do with friends like to hangout Like if i want to hangout with another new guy friend my age 24 i do not really know what to plan And i do not really want to do anything either It feels so weird to try and make friends it feels easier to ask someone out on a date than ask them to hangout as friends I do not talk,Depression

I think I am going to kill myself tonightIve been living with mental issues since about middle school Mainly being depressed and having a lot of issues with who I amhow I look The only time that I started accepting myself was when I was in a relationship and had someone there to remind me that at least they thought I was attractive and that was all that mattered However my insecurities eventually got the best of me and I became toxic and jealous which led to the end of the relationship several months agoI deserved that and she deserved better I know that I hurt her a lot and I have trouble living with that It also reduces my self image further to where I have trouble living with myself in general I think I was incredibly lucky to have been in a relationship with someone like that and I do not think it will happen again I do not want it to happen again because I know it would end the same way I have been in therapy and help groups since the break up trying to deal with myself and be a better person but I have not noticed any improvementI think at this point I am just a burden and holding the people around me back I am always bringing up my issues and wanting to deal with them but it is just at a point now where no one wants to see me anymore because of that I am also scared of them seeing that toxic part of me that I am having trouble changing and leaving meI feel bad that people will be hurt by this but I hope that they will be able to move on quickly Someone always loses in a fight,Suicidal

what do I do So 3 years ago I started experiencing a lot of anxiety and sudden depressive episodes that I didnt know the reason for And then two months after I started profusely sweating in my palms feet and armpits And these symptoms are constant almost never ending Im always in stress worrying when Im going to start sweating again and therefore get super cold and uncomfortable and unable to handle not only social situations but even doing something at home I had to give up so many hobbies of mine because they make me feel uncomfortable now due to the hand sweating Nobody ever told me what the hell happened to me and why I cant stop this no matter how hard I try I know the sweating is psychological because when I miraculously manage to not think about it for a while Im okay Or when I get drunk but I cant be drunk every day so I just have to bear with it These past three years I havent been living most of the time Ive been surviving and trying to stay sane Though there are good days when Im almost totally fine there are periods when Ive even thought about ending my life Im not sure what happened to me if it was trauma or not I just know nothing is helping me at the moment and I just want to ask if anyone here could give me some advise Btw Im seeing a clinical psychologist and were trying to work on it by various kinds of meditation relaxation stress relief but nothing works long term Im starting to feel like I cant relate to anyone and that my issue is so strange Im probably the only person on earth experiencing this and its just fogging my brain Im getting hopeless here this week its especially bad And Im scared that this will go on forever,Anxiety/Stress

Some of the earliest thoughts I remember were of how I hated the voice in my head When I was young all I ever wanted to be was older and I learned to hate and look down on all kids including myself Just about every facet of life that I could not control as well as some that I could I loathed myself for I have always been too introspective for my own good and as I got older my selfloathing only festered and grew I was extremely outgoing and focused on making myself a target to be laughed at for popularity which I despised myself for needing the attention In order to compensate for the overwhelming guilt I constantly caused myself as soon as I hit the age for dating I never stopped and throughout my school days hopped in and out of doomed relationships in order to distract myself from myself I would always put my girlfriend on a pedestal and give her anything and everything they would want until eventually I lost feelings and became numb to them and myself for a while before moving on to a new distraction With each failed relationships added a host of new reasons to hate myself for My last two years of high school is when I developed depression and I ended up getting ostracized from my friend group When my depression started I became immediately and increasingly self destructive until eventually I decided that I wanted to force my personality to change completely Through much selfdeprecation I stopped being the funny and loud extrovert and became silent and pushed everyone away During this time of isolation my mental health plummeted and over a long term unhealthy relationship I finally became totally emotionally numb At this point I feel dissociated and the only way I can get my brain to feel something is by smoking doing drugs starving myself cutting or masturbating and anytime I attempt to quit any of the coping mechanisms I just end up doing the others a dangerous amount moreI feel stuck I have no will to get better I cannot muster the desire to do anything positive for myself because of my self loathing At this point I think I am incapable of loving myself And because of it I ruin every relationship I have I am the ghost of my family the pity of my acquaintances and I just lost the only person who I thought really understood meI genuinely feel at the end of my rope and I hate myself for being too scared to let go i will never find true fulfillment in life because i am incapable of loving myself,Depression

I have read many posts here but nothing felt quite relatable Yeah I had some things happen to me in the past child neglect early passing of parent raped as a kid and again as a teen but I do not want to put an end of my life because of this as I genuinely do not care Heck I could be abused tomorrow and would not care Things that should be traumatic to me are not memories do not haunt me nothing at all I do not want to die because I hate myself or because my life is miserable I do not like myself or love my life either but these things do not make me suicidal I am not sad I am just lazy af to do anything I am quite on a successful way when it comes to wealth and education but I just do not see the point of it all There is no purpose I do not have a reason to live I am only making excuses to not die I do not have a goal because I do not feel like working towards one I am just too lazy to do anything at all I do not want to be important or significant because it requires too much energy Idk its hard to explain but I see life as a game People like to play a game because of the achievements ranks status goals etc But I am too lazy to even open it Life is just meaningless to me and people have told me do things that make you happy look for a meaning but they do not realize that it feels like such a chore I am already too unmotivated to look for a purpose I want to die because life is such a waste of time and energy Happy moments are temporary but happy moments I am going to do not make me want to live There is just no reason to be here friends and family they can deal with death I already quite distanced myself from them yeah they will be sad but they are strong enough to get up and live Not that you may have reached the end what gets you out of bed Because there is no purpose,Suicidal

Concussion anxiety taking over my life Let me just preface this by saying Ive been essentially the hugest hypochondriac my entire life even to the point of freaking out over a bat maybe biting me after it flew over my head once Ive never been this anxious about anything because getting a life threatening TBI is my hugest fear and its basically consumed me Almost two full days ago I slammed my head four times within two or so hours against a few different walls Not ruthlessly hard but just hard enough to worry I matched basically no concussion symptoms at the time but it hasnt stopped me from flipping out excessively Since I woke up yesterday though Ive gotten minor potential symptoms that made it so I couldnt function in my normal life without freaking out which has worried me While I didnt get a headache I had minor nonpainful yet strange feeling head pressure especially when moving it slight sensitivity to light occasionally feeling dazed me not being able to remember or place words in sentences etc It became rough trying to figure out which symptoms were from me freaking myself out and which could be potentially real I even stopped drinking coffee because Im so freaked out caffeine could make my concussion worse The worst part came last night when I dozed off while hanging out with friends watching a movie around 8 I couldnt sleep I kept jerking myself awake and my body refused to do anything heart racing and it got to the point I kept taking 20 hour power naps until midnight where Id wake up in a total daze with some of the worst anxiety Ive had in my life So reasonably I Googled symptoms to subdermal hematomas which freaked me out even more because now Im convinced I have a brain bleed I woke up this morning and I still feel dazed still shaking even though the only remaining concussion symptom is me feeling pretty dumb and detached from the world Even after friends whove had real concussions reassured me nothings helped in fact me Googling shit made it worse like always I guess my rant results to me asking whether or not Im justified being like this Ive been honest to God debating on just driving to an ER or something immediately despite potential freakout and the fact Im only 18 because almost nothing else has entered my mind The anxiety has been consuming me and Im 100 convinced Im dying and its the worst,Anxiety/Stress

tw terrorism death amp x 00b i f australia have crippling anxiety surrounding flying and i really want to figure out how to deal with it i didn t know the root cause of this fear until i wa about or so when i wa having a conversation with my parent during this conversation they casually brought up the fact that they had let me watch 9 on the news i wa at the time including all the footage of the moment the plane hit the twin tower people jumping out the recording of people saying goodbye to their loved one and so on for two week after apparently all i would say wa plane go boom despite not remembering any of this it check out a i ve always had a very deep seeded fear of flying for a long a i can remember and i wa clearly just a tad traumatised by this i do remember being a child and always cry in not wanting to go on family holiday because i wa convinced there were bomb on the plane and would be looking under my seat and so on searching the last time i went on a plane wa when i wa for a family holiday where i wa admittedly a massive brat and refused to do any of the activity during the week because i wa so upset that i wa being forced to take mere domestic flight and just wanted to go home because of my ability to now refuse to step on a plane a an adult i have only been to two other country near australia which were all during my childhood it is not lost on me that this is still a very very very privileged position to be in and that there are far worse thing in life than not being well travelled however i would really like to get over my fear of flying because since it is impeding on my life for me my biggest hang up over flying is perhaps the lack of control associated with it i m at the whim of the pilot and the plane i know statistically i m more likely to die in just about any other way but i think what make me not have a crippling phobia of anything else is that i probably delude myself into thinking i have more control in those other situation eg if i get into a train crash or something i have more of a chance of surviving by kicking a window out or someone else dragging me out and often activity like driving are just necessary for going about daily life so i can justify the risk however flying isn t some absolute necessity so i have a far harder time justifying it and am completely distraught over the idea of dying just because i wanted to go on some silly holiday i wa intending to do some travel this year since i ve graduated university and thought i had managed my fear i am supremely grateful that money isn t an issue for me so i m more than happy to spend more on flight with safe airline like qantas for me not to have a complete breakdown mid flight and figured a lot of my anxiety could hopefully be managed through that but the latest china eastern situation ha sent me into a spiral and i m not doing great obviously can t compare it to what the poor victim and their loved one are experiencing i tried to stay away from it but i accidentally saw the still of the plane vertically diving and i nearly threw up i had quite similar reaction to other plane crash in my lifetime and they completely derail my life for week afterwards because i get so upset from it i apologise for how long this post is just a bit of a mess at the moment and have achieved absolutely nothing today except writing this post i m just not really sure where to go from here but am open to any suggestion thank you so much for your comment in advance i genuinely really appreciate it,Depression

Feeling Overwhelmed It takes more to overwhelm some people than others but the feeling and the impact are the same overload and not knowing which way to turn next which triggers a downward spiral of anxiety Take these steps to create a plan and go from feeling overwhelmed to feeling peaceful again Identify what you can and cant control List your issues in three columns what you can control what you can influence and what is outwith your control Focus on solutions Now that you have perspective on what you can and cant control identify your chosen end point for each issue Shift your focus from the problems to the solutions Prioritise your actions Consider your chosen solutions in terms of how important they are and how urgent they are Firstly deal with the issues that are both important and urgent then move to the other important issues As a general rule deal with the important issues over the urgent issues herein lies the path to living sustainably crisis free Communicate With your plan in place communicate with those who may be affected its incredible how supportive people can be once they understand your situation Eat well Overwhelm commonly leads to skipping meals or overreliance on junk food Buy in some healthy foods and snacks to give you the nutrition youll need to play your best game Gratitude It is easy to lose sight of the good things happening when we feel overwhelmed Adopt the habit of regularly reflecting on the things youre grateful for that youre taking control of challenging situations that youre on your way to calmer times that youre learning a lot about yourself perhaps that others are supporting you Blow off some steam Exercise whatever works best for you a brisk walk hit the weights an hour on the bike has a magical ability to burn off that anxiety and reset all those neurotransmitters It will also help you get that good nights sleep Get your rest Know that youre focusing on your priorities with a clear plan Youre pushing yourself hard through the day A good nights sleep is the smartest thing you can give yourself to keep working through your list Celebrate your successes Each step forward is worthy of celebration Be proud of yourself for taking control and moving forward Each success leads to further steps forward Overwhelm is a situation everyone is familiar with Short term episodes are unlikely to harm us Longer term however it can be debilitating Remember there is help out there for those times you need support in getting back on top of things,Anxiety/Stress

HeyI think this is going to be sort of long but I need someone who does not know me personally to read my thoughts and give me advice on a few thingsThe first is that I think my views on society and even myself are getting changed by my friend I am not going to get into detail as to what type of views its not important but I think because I have such a big need to get along with everyone and not upset anyone that I sort of just go along with whatever The second possibly bigger problem is that the person I am dating once straight and heterosexual recently told me they are non binary While that itself is not a problem I am straight and I feel like its not fair to either of us to stay but they make me feel like I have to They always feel suicidal and I do not know what they would do if I left them It makes me feel like a shitty person and I do not know what to doAnother problem is I am religious I believe in God but some of my closer friends and the person I am dating does not It makes me feel extremely uncomfortable sometimes and I do not like what the talk about sometimes Of course I keep my mouth shut but it makes me feel worse in the endYet another thing I am having problems with is figuring out who I am Id there is any purpose of my existence in this Earth I do not know what I want to do I do not know what I am going to do I just graduated high school and I am going to college I almost feel like I do not want to but its too late to back out now and even if I could I would not know what to do There is other stuff but I guess this is all I want to say right now Thanks for listening any advice would be gratefully appreciated x Might be getting a little existential,Depression

Redditors with trust issues due to childhood trauma how do you cope and build trust with others am a 19yearold college student trying to make the best of my life despite my past Growing up I had a difficult childhood My father and stepfather were both abusive and would often beat me up for the smallest reasons I remember hiding in my room and praying that they would leave me alone but it never worked My mom was an alcoholic and she never showed me any love or affection She was always too drunk to care about anything that was going on in my life I felt like I was all alone in the world and I had no one to turn to As a result of my childhood I developed a deep sense of trust issues I find it hard to open up to people and let them in I am constantly afraid that they will hurt me in some way just like my father and stepfather did But despite all of this I refuse to let my past define me I am determined to make something of myself and create a better life for me College has been a fresh start for me and I have made some friends who seem to genuinely care about me However even with my newfound friendships I still find it hard to trust people I am always on guard and keep people at arms length afraid that they will hurt me like my father and stepfather did Sometimes I wish I could forget about my past and start anew but its always there in the back of my mind haunting me Its hard to let go of the pain and the memories that shaped me into the person I am today But I refuse to let my past hold me back I am determined to overcome my trust issues and build a better future for myself,Anxiety/Stress

My HIV Health Anxiety Nightmare I participated in a low risk activity It is estimated the chances of acquiring HIV are about 1 in 2500 Nevertheless it has happened 45 weeks later I got the flu Cue health anxiety meltdown I tested at 55 weeks Negative 3 other tests later Negative I have just ordered my final test at 12 weeks I know its probably unnecessary but I just need to do it to be able to move on Funnily enough this is happened before 3 weeks after a risk where my doctor said that HIV transmission just doesnt happen this way I absolutely freaked Cue two negative tests and 15 years of worry and not fully believing I was HIV negative I know better than anyone the toll this condition can have on you From the physical symptoms to the stress the incessant symptom googling the constant feeling of your lymph nodes or checking your tongue in the mirror or freaking at a bump on your head thats probably been there since you were born It fucking sucks 200 of testing later lets hope this chapter of my life has ended And I can start living again Because Ive been living in my head for a while now,Anxiety/Stress

Probably is not the right subreddit to post this in but I just want opinionsWhat should I do with myselfShould I enlist in the militaryI know some people are automatically going to say yes but I want some honest opinionsBasically I am 23 years old and I feel completely lost in life I am still living with my parents I am working as a janitor at a school I have a useless college degree I have never had a girlfriend or been on any dates Even though I am young I just feel like I am already failing miserably I frequently consider suicide as a serious solution I was going to enlist in the military right out of high school However I took four years of HS JROTC and absolutely hated it My experience with ROTC ruined my view of the military and I decided not to join Now here I am five years later and I am not sure what to doNow here is my other issue I have very bad anxiety Like I live in a constant state of anxiety and I am pretty sure I have depression because I actively consider suicide frequently I get stressed out very easily and I feel very stupid because I frequently misinterpret simple instructions which honestly might just be anxiety setting me off in the wrong direction but still I am also not physically fit in any capacity I can hardly perform push ups I only recently started considering enlisting again because some people have told me that joining the military helped them a lot with their lives and I am just wanting some honest opinions on if anyone thinks I should join or if I should figure something else out What should I do in life,Depression

Convinced myself I have Huntingtons disease The rational side of me knows that these symptoms have either been there for a while or they can easily be explained by any number of other less serious causes Not to mention that as far as I know no one in my family has this disease I was reading about Lewy body dementia and someone had described it as being a mix of Parkinsons dementia and Huntingtons the last of which Id never heard of So I went to learn about it and since Im me I started drawing parallels between the symptoms and things Ive either been experiencing or that I wasnt experiencing until they were suggested Firstly Im in the typical age range when symptoms manifest My confusion occasional inability to understand things indecisiveness occasional problems with concentration forgetfulness and fatigue must be due to this disease not because I never get enough sleep My bouts of dizzinessvertigo are the coordination problems even though theyre most likely a mix of exhaustion and severe tension headaches Ive noticed lately my index finger on my right hand sometimes twitches when I hold it just right on my mouse never mind the fact that Ive had that happen before with other parts of me if I position myself a certain way Fidgeting must be a symptom too even though Ive fidgeted my WHOLE LIFE Me being freezing cold must be the telltale tremors And the anxiety and depression Ive had for what feels like forever MUST be Huntingtons too right Muscle stiffness cant possibly be due to me being out of shape My inability to remember a word now and again or have words come out coherently must be from illness and not the fact that my brain to mouth filter has always been haywire I have issues swallowing and breathing that could be due to Huntingtons or you know the esophagus problems Ive been having Also read that one possible symptom is visual disturbances and lately Ive been experiencing what looks like rippling water in my left eye I realize that could be any number of things and generally as long as my vision itself is okay its nothing major But if I was thinking rationally I wouldnt be posting here And while the disease seems to be hereditary all I had to do was read something about how only a majority of cases are inherited implying that some people 13 of cases can still develop it even with no family history Not to mention that practically all these symptoms can be caused by ANXIETY too Never mind I had a CT about a year ago when many of these same things were happening that was normal Never mind its rare something like 15000 people in the entire US have it NOPE must be Huntingtons,Anxiety/Stress

I have finally been able to see my anxiety and Im heartbroken For as long as I can remember I have always suffered from anxiety Perhaps it runs in my family Yet I was never able to name it or put a label on it During COVID it took a toll on me and the biggest hit was taken by my marriage For past half year so much has happened in my life that I feel like I am living someone elses life The only good thing that has come out of it is my ability to finally see my anxiety building up and how I channel it I am so heartbroken to see that I mostly took my anxiety and put it in my marriage Anxiety builds up in me for various reasons Sometimes it is related to work sometimes things not going my way or sometimes pretty mundane things It slowly creeps in me and my mood is spoiled Previously I was never able to tell that anxiety had built up in me I would only become aware of it when I blew the lid on something During COVID the unfortunate victim became my spouse I also blew up my relationship with my boss during that time So once I spoiled the mood around me or picked up a fight I would see that things are fucked up I always blamed the spouse work or boss for the fight or issues yet the culprit was mostly my anxiety that slowly built up and got channeled where I had hidden resentments It is only during past week that I have finally been able to see the pattern and it is startling I feel so ashamed and resentful The sad truth is that I dont see any quick remedy for this either You see there will always be some dormant resentments inside me There are issues between me and my spouse that we cannot agree on There will always be resentment which I have how I get treated at work or how I handle more work than the others etc And whenever anxiety builds up it needs a channel for relief Im afraid my mind will always pick these targets over and over I have come to this community to ask for your advice that what I feel is also how you have felt at some time I want to take this anxiety and channel it for something constructive I cant change my spouse I cant get that promotion But I can always put effort to find a new job always choose kindness for my spouse instead of turning things to arguments How does one make this change How not being able to channel this energy constructively not become an anxiety in itself too I need some encouragement and guidance Thanks,Depression

I think my mom found the explicit photos on my phone and I feel like throwing up So ive been masturbating for a few years and i started saving videosphotos to my phone so its easier to get to I always keep them in the hidden section of my phone Last night I forgot to hide them and I woke up and found them in the recently deleted section and other app I think she went through The latest notification was 2 hours before I woke up so I was certain my phone was turned on The photos themselves were just photos and videos of girls I thought were really attractive they were over 18 and would use to get off to Now since they are in the recently deleted tab notifications were only 2 hours old and I had notifications from before 2 hours ago but before I went to sleep I had apps open which I never use and my phone wasnt in the spot I last had it So the title says I think because im just hoping it was me in my sleep and I was really tired since some photos were perfectly fine and she hasnt said anything about it yet So incase she actually saw the photosvideos can someone give me some advice on things like what to say do when or if she brings it up,Anxiety/Stress

I currently have no value to anyone other than sentimental value The love my family has for me comes only from the fact that I exist Their lives would be no worse had I never been born there is only one person I can say for certain I had a life changing impact on Because of what I did her ability to trust people will likely never be the same My confession is in my previous posts I also hurt my exgirlfriend by being a constantly anxious and socially brainless fuck as well as a generally terrible boyfriend and person I have repeatedly failed every mentor I have and I did basically nothing in the last two years My grades have recovered in the last semester and while I think I might still be able to live a decent life overall I do not think I deserve it I am a piece of shit who has stagnated in every area and I am more of a collection of vague desires to master skills that I never made any progress on despite having ample time than a person with a personality I hurt people and wasted years and I think I could have had a great life if I were able to rewind and undo the damage I have done and unwaste the years I have wasted It bothers me so much that I probably could have had a great life and did great things and never had hurt people and scarred them I do not think I deserve to live long and a decent life because I have squandered and misused the gift of life My victim does not deserve to live a worse life just because I was a dumb horny idiot but she probably will and I cannot stand it She does not deserve to see how I am probably much less affected by the guilt than she is by the broken trust and trauma she does not deserve to see how I may live a happier life than her despite her having done nothing to deserve that trauma while I am punished only with guilt far less crippling On the other hand my family definitely does not deserve the emotional loss from my death I would give my mind my body and my future if it meant I could again be someone whose name does not bring up bad memories for people I ended up half venting and I hope that is fine and you still read my wall of text I might still be capable of living a decent life but I do not think I deserve to be able to live one because of the permanent damage I have caused others,Suicidal
What can be the cause and treatment for daily panicanxiety attack 27M Long story short Im dealing with mental health for 20 years now and for the last six months or so I have almost every day a panic attack since waking till evening I see a psychiatrist and psychologist and recently started a new job I know I have my issues but cant wrap my head around having so much anxiety its net getting better or easier with time Usually when im in peak anxiety i go on a few hours listening to music and crying in a dark room bender while smoking to much In the process I do meditation a trying to walk 23 hours a day but I fucking hate sports and Im lazy Thank you I felt the need to vent sorry for shitty English,Anxiety/Stress
Today my parents and I had a conversation about my future I told them I just wanted a job with a decent paycheck because as long as you have enough money to get by that is all that matters right They told me that I am too young to specifically choose a job and then my dad asked me whether I liked sciences or arts more Personally I like arts more but I do not even have any fucking time to learn to draw and animate Why you may ask it is because my mom signed me up for so many classes that especially during the weekdays I hardly even have time to sit down I cannot teach myself because digital art software always costs money and I cannot pay for anything online because I am too young to have PayPal and it takes time that I do not have to learn how to use the software Anyways back to the conversation with my parents I told them that I do not really have any choice but to become a doctor and my dad said that I do not have to but then he also told me that I should not really choose arts because apparently it is vague and you cannot really get a job in that Then both my parents started going on and on about how I should focus on my studies My dad even told me that I should stop watching TV and YouTube and playing video games Using social media and YouTube is my only refuge the only thing that gets even remotely close to making me feel better I am too young to choose a specific career path but too old to relax It just does not make sense to me He told me that it would only be until I finish my OLevels and Alevels O and A Levels are what we have for high school in my country OLevels is 3 years and ALevels is 2 years but I know very well that I will be just as busy even after graduating I do not really like studying I do not even have a favorite subject anymore because of how much I hate studying it just makes me feel so trapped that shoving my face in textbooks all day is the only way to success Both my parents kept saying that I have to work hard work hard but to me getting out of bed is hard enough let alone working I did not mention that whatever mental illness I have I have not been diagnosed yet so I cannot be sure makes doing anything hard for me because they would say that it is laziness not mental illness Who knows maybe I am just a lazy ass trying to make excuses I told my parents that I did not want to become a doctor because it is not my passion and it is stressful My dad told me Oh it is not that stressful you can work in a clinic 9 to 5 My mom tried to tell me some story about how she wanted to become a banker but she could not and that I cannot achieve my dreams because imagination is different from reality Yeah I already know that I did not need her to remind me I tried to tell her that I already know but my dad said something along the lines of Oh why did you stop her like that that is disrespectful is that how you talk to your mom I had no choice but to stop that conversation because I was about to cry and whenever I cry in front of my parents they give me shit advice when 90 of the time when I cry I really just want to be cuddled until I feel better All in all the conversation confused me because my parents told me that whatever job I get should make me happy and that they are not forcing me to be a doctor but at the same time what they said was definitely trying to push me towards becoming a doctor Why else would they be telling me how good becoming a doctor isMaybe my mom was right Maybe it is time to say goodbye to me wanting to be an animator or a voice actor or an author or maybe a teacher because I have to become a doctor to pay the bills and it is also my duty apparently to make my parents happy and to take care of them when they get oldHowever if this is the life I have to live I do not want to live at allGoodbye dreams it was nice knowing you it is so fucking painful knowing that I have to let go of my dreams,Suicidal

Hello it is a rather long story basically my whole life and how my parents behavior and little comments affected my decisions in life and make me really really sadI am 20yo at the moment female but have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was 13 I am not diagnosed with depression have not been able to go the psychotherapy because my parents think I am joking and it is over exaggerated Back in 2014 when I was hitting puberty I had an awful summer where I realized everything is meaningless and whatever I do in my life is going to be forgotten and had my nihilistic phase crying all day that I am useless I have no friends no one to understand me nothing It was rather unusual because my mom has given me love all my life my father was a bit on the cold side as he stopped expressing love towards me once i started growing up and decided to raise me up as a boy and not spoil me All in all my 2014 summer was pretty sad I told my mom about it and that I wanted to see a psychiatrist because I did not feel too well but she brushed it off with If you go to the psychiatrist at 13 you are going to become insane at 30 its a stigma in my country to seek help from a professional about your mental health During the years after that i grew out of this nihilistic phase decided that even though everything is meaningless you can still enjoy the good things in life I still had my episodes of wanting to kill myself end it all being unbothrred with everything crying over boys broken hearted and many more occasions Overall I still had that it is whatever if I live or die today and it was getting stronger when i was struggling with love when it was raining when my parents put me down for not being the first in mathsphysics competitions had different POV from their wanted to go out with my friends as much as they could enjoy life they are basically super strict and did not allow me lots of things even when i begged I was also not allowed to have any boyfriends till 21 no joke hereFf to 2020 I finally decide to begin a serious relationship with this guy even keep it in a secret and love him and enjoy life I am also studying abroad in the Netherlands first year student so we keep it long distance it is 2 months into the uni year and i become super homesick for my family and my bf i am crying all the time i am also struggling with uni and just cannot stand it anymore to which coronavirus gets out of control and they let us go online so i get back to my country My parents are happy I am happy but i am worried how i should tell yhem about my bf and my struggles with uni They are pretty chill because I have lots of time till the end of the uni year so even if i struggle i can get better Ff May 2021 my parents become super toxic telling me how i should study spend this amount of time to this course and doing this and that to which i reply that i will not follow their advice because things are much different than they were 30years ago They become super oppressive and i decide to run away and leave them a letter in which i say what i feel that i have a bf and all the things i cannot do I do so and my mother just stops talking to me so i phone my father and he tells me to come back sit down and talk with them I do so we have a talk with my father and he is pretty chill about the situation they let me see my bf and travel to his town with one thing in mind that i shall keep studying I have no problem with that and ff 2 months they are back on their old shit telling me that if i do not pass my exams i can never see him that I am not trying as hard as i can that ill end up as a 711 worker that all I am interested in now is only sex and much more things I will not write down I scream out loud during one fight that I am fed up with all that disrespect and behavior and burst into tears and start shaking they try comforting me but i doubt that they really understand what is going on in my mindToday i had an argument with my mother and in the middle of it when neither me nor her was talking she just commented or you are going to tell us that you are going to kill yourself again like it was a fucking joke and i do not feel that way I am just done with this shit i am so close to harming myself i cannot stand this anymore its been every 23 days its like they just cannot understand me and just want to obey everything they say i do not even know if it is just me and my head is exaggarating these situations or they really are causing me mental health problems I am just tired of crying myself to sleep and trying to do my best while it still being not appreciated Are my parents being the problem,Depression

You see whenever you talk about killing yourself there will be hundreds of people trying to convince you it is going to get better life is beautiful your mom will feel bad do not do it Etc etc The useless crap sugar coating on my already deteriorating mental health But on this subreddit it is not like that I can talk about suicide freely Nobody tries to talk me out of it rather people relate to my pain it is sort of satisfying to know that I am not the only one having these disturbing thoughts And I am not the only one who thinks living is useless and dying would be much much better So thanks to people who are just as fucked in the mind as me May we get to die soon I know this will sound fucked up to others but when you have nothing else to look forward to dying sounds so freeing and peaceful I wish that peace for people who are desperately seeking it May we finally be happy again even if it means we cease to exist I like it here because nobody tries to guilt trip me or sugar coat things,Suicidal

Maybe the song Achilles come down has it rightit is just so weird how people treat relationships how easily they discart it for something better how much being with someone gives you hope until it is just another reason to commit suicide not like a broken heart will necessarily make you jump but for a time in my life I even tried pursuing a relationship because I know it never works with me because I knew they made me want to kill myself but it was never enough and it seemed that no amount of birthday wishes would bring me closer to not existing anymoreBut you know despite all the bullshit the little broken pieces of me i left scattered behind and just giving up on everything I still manage to stumble into someone I love by accident and this one is truly special and different in a way none of my relationships was before But it just makes me wonder how ironic it would be if it just broke appart and left me so much less than the little I am now if hope and love just serve as entries when the main dish is always misery and hopeless and I wonder if everything falls appart again will I just be someone looking for hope like an addict looks for his next fix or will I be lucky enough to never wake up again Love is such a scary thing,Depression
let us face it there is very little good in the world The things that keep us going is just some false hope that things will get better but they do not get better The world is a cold place one where nobody gives a fuck about you Nobody truly understands you we are alone inside our heads trapped in a prison of torment a merrygoround of hell The only reprieve is from drugs but the price for that is more future torment it is like a sick joke To believe otherwise is just burying my head in the sand it is comforting to believe in positivity but it is also comforting to believe in fairy tales I cannot live and I cannot die I am barely carrying on Every time I start picking up the peices life knocks them back down again After years and years I have come to realize that this is my destiny My only fear is that death brings no respite only deeper versions of hell To see the positive in things is delusional,Suicidal

Anxiety has ruined me Just a vent tbh Ive suffered from anxiety my whole life and as I grow older I feel my anxiety getting progressively worse instead of better Ironically even therapy scares me as Im not really one to open up in front of others in fear of burdeningboring them Sounds silly but I almost feel embarrassed paying someone to help me who otherwise wouldnt give me a second thought On the topic of skills I wholeheartedly believe I have 0 skills Ive always been told Im smart but no one sees how much time and struggle goes behind good grades When Im honest about not being intelligent understandably people think Im fishing for compliments Even then I think I just got lucky with good questions and random guesses Literally no achievement I think I really deserved and was more abt the odds being in my favour Its all due to subliminals and manifestation rather than talent As well my social skills are horrendous Im so awkward w people and can barely keep a convo going with those close to me I rely on them to start and keep convos going cause Im just so boring and unfunny I have an extremely hard time communicating with males too Idk I completely stiffen up and come across so awkward I like art but again Im not talented at it despite so much practice and was rejected from an art school unsurprisingly Im learning to drive and after 3 lessons I still cant move a car without sweating buckets shaking and struggling to control it even moving off is so challenging Im expecting to waste a ton of money due to my incompetence at understanding basic instructions and crippling fear Im bad at sports games mediocre at cooking and just about everything Ive tried Heck I cant even ride a bike I couldnt list a single talent I have Anything Im half decent at is a result of 5x the effort generally needed For example Im currently writing an essay thats taken me all day to understand and plan when it was only meant to be an hour task There just doesnt seem to be anything redeemable for me My anxiety has made me become more and more closed off from people I will sit in toilets at school in fear of being looked at I never contribute to class in fear of being wrong I sit on the bus with my hood on so Im not looked at Even when I briefly had a job I couldnt work out the basics that everyone learnt in a day It was very telling that this incompetence wasnt only reflecting in school but other places Sweating is one of the main symptoms I experience and its created deep rooted insecurities for me I can stay somewhat in peace at home but I do have struggles here and there But obviously its not practical to rely on home for peace as I fear I will completely isolate myself this way Does anyone have a similar situation,Anxiety/Stress

This is a throwaway as my friends and some colleagues know my main reddit Also sorry if this is not the right subredditampx200BTo start I had a pretty good upbringing and almost no problems at all I went through school without much trouble My parents were good to me Really nothing to complain about But I just do not feel joy in anything at all hobbys I had just feel so mundane like everything else I quickly get annoyed or just drained when I am able to hangout with friends When I am alone for too long my thoughts just get so deep and sometimes get suicidal This has been going on for sometimeDespite Covid19 rampaging around I could find a somewhat decent paying job I drowned myself in work just so I could not think at all My colleague and now somewhat close friend was worried about me working too much but to be honest I do not mind it That was until she made it clear I was really just living to work the past year I recently made a promotion to a supervising position but frankly it does not do much to me it is not that I miss my old work that much but it just does not trigger anything inside of me If anything I am sort of left with a bittersweet feeling This is just me in a nutshell A 22 year old who had a normal upbringing who for some reason has no joy in life or a goal at all Why,Depression
I feel like shit whenever I allow myself to feel anything I have been alone my whole life trusting people and feeling loved are several tiers above my current position on my hierarchy of needs and they always have been and I think they probably always will be and yet I do not want to die but living is so hard so much work and it is obviously not worth it my reward for a long days work is coming home and feeling like shit going to bed probably after crying myself to sleep if I had any energy to spare after work and another day of the same nothing gets better and I am too weak to fix or change anything and too alone to get help I know that eventually my will to live will be eroded completely and I will finally kill myself I do not know whether that will be weeks months or hopefully not years but eventually I will either get my hands on an easier way to go in which case I will probably kill myself as soon as possible or I will grow a pair and off myself with a kitchen knife and a bottle of ibuprofen I think if I had a single reason just one to go on then I could make it work just one close friend one shred of hope or faith one source of support whatever the fuck that looks like and I could rationalize the pain and square it away maybe even get the strength to become the version of myself I desperately wish to be But I do not think that will ever happen and that is my fault My sister told me the other day that I always seem cold and distant that is why nobody likes being around me nobody confides in me or allows me to confide in them I am a piece of human debris from my parents loveless marriage flanked on all sides with valuable and good people while I crumble under the slightest pressure I learned to only be comfortable alone to trust nobody and that I am worthless I do not know if I can find the strength to unlearn these things or if it is even possible I refuse to tolerate my current existence for much longer Soon I will either be dead or someone different someone humanlike I do not know why I bother writing any of this I do not know shit about fuck I do not know who I am or what I am death seems just so simple and obvious I do not understand how anybody can see life as being worth it,Suicidal

For starters I have Borderline Personality Disorder a condition that makes me emotionally unstable and amplifies negative emotions tenfold it is the hardest personality disorder to live with and the least likely to be taken seriously by others Look it up it is actually quite sad Add to that a debilitating addiction to Crystal meth a drug that is statistically harder to quit than heroin Meth like Borderline Personality carries a heavy stigma one that opioid addicts and even crackheads are not given as much The withdrawal comes with crippling physical fatigue and weakness making everything exhausting But worst of all is a feeling of intolerable depression that comes from nowhere a depression like nothing you have ever felt before I dread the amplification of that depression from my BPD and thus I stay high for weeks until I am broke When I first wake up detoxing I feel the depression spread through me and my thoughts are consumed with darkness To top it off I am about to be homeless again in a matter of weeks and I am terrified absolutely terrified of living outdoors in this constant extreme humidity in the middle of summer So to recap I have withdrawals that because intolerable depression a personality disorder that amplifies negative emotions and I am going to be homeless in nonstop summer heat BPD is theworsr personality disorder and carries the worst stigma of its kindMeth is the worst drug and carries the worst stigma of its kindHomeless people are so stigmatized they are treated like scum like second class citizens So in conclusion I am about to experience the worst depression possible and be treated with nothing but cruelty and apathy Oh and I am very likely to die a slow death from heat stroke as people step over me and let it happen because they hate meI have enough fentanyl in my possession to kill 10 people a needle and a fate so grim I cannot evenwrap my head around it All I think about is suicide No one would care even though my situation is objectively worse than everyone elses and I know I deserve the utmost sympathy I am the least likely to receive itSo why should not I kill myself Where to begin,Suicidal

I do not think many people saw my post from earlier this week but the tldr is I have been suicidal for a while but especially the last month or so there is a forest fire raging less than 10 miles from my house I called the suicide hotline because the fire and the thought of evacuation are making me feel way more ready to actually end myself The suicide hotline operator told me that she thought I was a prank caller then implied I should stop calling because I have called before multiple times and hung up on meI thought the fire was bad a few days ago but its only 2 miles from my house now The forest service has done nothing to prevent the fire until today and even right now they will not answer any calls from people in the town and they only have those buckethelicopters working and no ground crew called my aunt who works for the forest service the next town over on the other side of the fire and she filled my family in They tried to back burn but we do not know how much it helped there is so much smoke that there were times today you could not even see the sun I am watching it as I type and I can actually see the trees catching flame from this distance Its surrealI have had most of my belongings packed for the last three days in case I really did need to leave but I am honestly having trouble imagining myself being able to pack up evacuate and not kill myself I was already planning on killing myself at the end of the summer because I dropped out of college after two semesters and am already going to be stuck in debt until I am dead anyway and Ill never be able to go back even if I wanted to My only source of income will be burned in the fire if my home burns down because its a farm I am friendless boyfriendless I am broke my family is a mess I am lonely as hell I have probably got half a dozen mental problems that I need professional help for but I am uninsured and broke and the one therapy session I have gone to she ignored me when I tried to explain my problems and symptoms and just made me answer a mhs questionnaire she read off her computer And I cannot stop thinking about my boyfriend who killed himself last year I have got some shitty stuff going on right now and I cannot see myself finding a way out of it besides taking my own lifeI cannot wrap my head around the way the suicide hotline operator acted What the hell did I say or do that made her think my call was disingenuous Is it because I have called there before I have before because it really had helped me up to this point to deal with all the horrible things in my life I do not know how to deal with A few times the calls have felt forced and like the operator was just trying to get me off the line but for so many of the times I talked to someone it honestly felt like they gave a shit about me which is something that I do not really think I have felt from the people in my real life in the same amount in a long timeI am trying hard not to feel hurt because that feels like it would be petty and selfish but I am hurt for myself but also strangely worried I guess I may still be here three days later but I feel more prepared willing and able to kill myself than I ever have before in my life I even have half of a suicide note drafted for if I have to do it What would have happened if she had said that to someone who was holding the gun or the rope or the bottle of pills in their hand already What the hell would have happened to someone who got her when they called in and were maybe just hoping to to talk to someone before they died and instead got accused of trying to abuse the system for their own amusement and were hung up onHow the hell could someone who works at one of these lines who are supposed to be trained in talking people down from these urges How could someone accuse someone who calls in of being a prankster and try to shame them for this perceived attack then after hearing the caller promise that they were genuinely afraid that they were going to commit suicide and wanted some comfort or help tell them that they have called too much before and then hang up I cannot stop thinking about what would have happened if someone else made that call instead of meThis makes things more complicated but even though I feel angry I also feel bad and guilty for feeling angry These operators are overworked volunteers and I know they have a script and a time limit and they cannot actually offer any advice and a bunch of other things that they can and cannot do These people are signing up to try to help people but still have a lot of limits and stressors put on them to be able to do so Their because is noble even if their methodology is flawed And I know that they get horrible horrible prank callers and sex callers all the time so I can understand trying to make sure they are not wasting their time on those who steal it for their own pleasure when real people suffer when they do not get the support they need I feel terrible for feeling hurt and angry at someone who was probably just trying to do her volunteer job to the best of her abilities But I just cannot get her voice out of my head especially now that I am sitting in my field watching the trees go up in flames in naked eyesight and now that I am trying to think of the fastest and least messy way to kill myself when I leave I cannot get it out of my head that she and maybe all the other people who helped me might have spent most of our calls thinking I was making it up for attention or for a laugh or god forbid for sexual perversion I know that I cannot call back to them even though I do not know if I know how to deal with this stuff without calling them and asking All the other times they have helped me feel tainted now which makes me feel way worse about my problems I just do not know what to say do think or feel anymore Update The Fire Has Gotten Worse,Suicidal

been on escitalopram for about year worked great for the first or year wa prescribed either or 0mg honestly don t remember the exact dosage eventually it started making me feel complacent with sleeping long hour and not having any energy not meeting my goal or even making goal in the first place and not caring about thing i used to i didn t feel depressed but felt like i wa not where i wanted to be in life and that the antidepressant were part of the problem i should also mention that part of the reason i take them is for anxiety when this happened about year ago i decided to go off of them over a period of month it wa a very slow process because of all the side effect it wa terrible once i wa finally off them i felt worse i did have more energy but it wa like anxious energy i could function on hour of sleep just fine whereas with the antidepressant i feel like i have the flu if i get le than 9 hour normal on the pill is 9 0 hour well once i wa finally off the pill i wa getting anxious over every little thing including driving i had just gotten a new job and wa failing at it my inlaws came to visit in two seperate trip and after the first trip i decided i had to go back on the pill asap a i couldn t handle it anymore random outburst of cry and feeling very depressed along with near constant anxiety which is not great when my in law already don t seem to like me much long story short i went back on the pill about year ago probably about a month or of being off of them but i have kept the dosage low mg a i d like to try getting off them again i am worried to get off them completely again to try new antidepressant a i ve been promoted a few time since i went back on them and i can t risk screwing up my job i did ask my doctor if i could take the lowest dose of my current antidepressant 0 mg while i switch to new one but she told me i would have to be completely off the old one before starting anything new now i am also contemplating just upping my dosage to higher than it wa before and seeing if that help but i m also worried about having to try to get off a high dosage again it wa so terrible i m mostly just wondering if anyone ha any similar experience and what you decided to do and how it worked for you i know going to my doctor is best but it hasn t been super helpful for me so i m just curious about personal experience and i just feel like rambling a bit i guess,Depression

Sometimes something so profound happens in life that a drastic change is required A complete and total system reboot and reprogramming Such is my story and in that same sense it is akin to trying to extract blood from a turnipMany people try to convince me that I am no lesser that I am just as human as they are The unfortunate truth is that I am not I am nothing like you I could never be like youI cannot whisk myself away into some fantasy reality where everything will be okay I cannot lie to myself and say that I will change I know what it would take for me to change yet I know that change would only be temporary I know I will end up exactly where I am as I am todayIt brings to light just how magnificent you humans truly are I still cannot even begin to grasp how you do the things you do almost without even skipping a beatIt amazes me that people still even try to relate to a thing like me or try to be compassionate towards me I am just a freak a monster I do not deserve any of it yet people persist it is awe inspiring trulyTo whatever extent there may be a fraction of hope that remains within the hollowed out tusk of the human I was born as Unfortunately words could never fill that void Not even compassionate kind encouraging wordsThe damage is done and I am far too aware of it to deny the overwhelming reality of it all I am here because of me I cannot blame it on anyone elseWhy would I take my pain and put it out into the world All I have to do is simply be present and people feel it They become more aware of the threat I am I have always compared it to having a neon sign on my forehead and to that extent I suppose I should be gratefulAt least people saw me for what I really am and made the right decision in avoiding me that is realityI have tried to play some role in this world and no matter what I just never fit that is reality I am so cold towards myself because it is all I have ever been shown on any consistent basis Sure every once in a while someone tries to show some sense of connection and it often results in both of us getting hurt or leaving with hurt feelings and regretthat is just what it is to deal with me I do not know why it is or what causes it it is just there I try my best to circumvent the issue by being more understanding and kind and compassionate but even that is not enough to really outweigh the impact I have on others It is still true that I am like a bad omen of sorts I bring bad luck to those who come near methat is just reality that is my reality I just do not want to push that on anyone anymore I used to desire connection love belonging But life has always had other plans for meI am the outlier an ever watchful eye that sees the beautiful treasures of humanity But I will never find my way into that vault I will never find my place amongst the most precious commodity There is no space there for me that is realityBut I can still admire just how beautiful you humans truly are even as a monster The Monster Who Grew a Heart,Depression

I 33 old man now lost my first love about 5 years ago I loved everything about her except she was not really into sex As happy as I was that kept on nailing into me and my depression plummeted me when I was in forced training at my work to have to work 100 hour weeks I am the second generation of that so I credit most of my mental illness to my busted up childhood as a result So I transformed into a shitty person from all of the anxiety of potentially being absent for her like I had done to me that she eventually got rid of me and never looked back I was erased from her life with such easeI entered another relationship about 2 12 years ago but I was not fully over my first and she had her mental issues as well I finally lost her recently because I am so on autopilot and do not put in enough effortThey were both gorgeous women and I will never get them their caliber or my youth back again I am on online dating Again And there is nothing but overweight and heavily tattooed women that were nothing like my exes The best part is I do not get a fart of interest anymore It was hard before but there was still something But now I do not even get a glance by the dumpster selection Knowing that my relationship and romantic life is behind me forever I am having panic attacks and crying nightly But in reality should us depressed people even date People do not give a fuck about us And more often than not we will let them down And then they will leave like they always do Even when we think we are fixed up this shit just comes right back Because of my depression I am boring I am toxic I am neurotic I am needy I am anxious I am awkward not well rounded in life I always knew I needed someone to compliment me but should we even be doing that when we are so broken I guess I need to think harder about suicide There not much bigger disappointment in life than being a man and not being able to attract anyone Are we meant to date,Depression

I am not really sure what I am expecting from this but it probably cannot do any harmI 18M have been depressed for a little under a year now and feeling suicidal on and off for most of that time Recently things have worsened and I have started cutting myself and I feel like I am on the edge of just killing myself I have not really got much to feel depressed about on the surface I live in a wealthy part of the UK I have got a decent family and I was lucky to go to a good enough school and have opportunities But that does not change how I feel which is hopeless and pretty neglected I have always been the quiet reserved one and I have not minded that so much I have always been fine with my own company especially since I was bullied mercilessly as a child People who know me well get more humour and jolliness than strangers but almost nobody knows anything actually personal about me Since I have always lived fairly far from town I never really had the same friendships as everyone else or the freedom to go out and make them even in my teenage years It has left me feeling lonely especially since many friends over the years have simply abandoned me Simply put I never seem like anyones first choice my parents have always focused on my brothers more than me and my friends are not really there for me at all they never have been Not one of them has asked if I have been OK in the last year despite my still spending time in groups with them I have tried asking for help or support but I never know how to say it I have always been very good at hiding my own feelings and problems and been the one who listens who solves other peoples problems Hey I am depressed and want to off myself got any tips is not the best conversation opener I have ever heard I knew a friend who described the looks he got when his depression became evident to his friends like a wounded animal He described how he felt everyone was permanently walking on eggshells around him I do not want that for myself especially not since I know that my parents would never let me out of their sight knowing I was suicidalMy boyfriend well where to start I genuinely thought he was the one stupid at my age as that sounds I know Everything had going so well but I wonder if our relationship has stopped being healthy recently He sometimes becomes argumentative and angry when we are texting about things and criticises things about me my life and my family Some of it is quite fair but the sheer hate and rage bordering on contempt I feel from him when he does this hurts me a lot Most of the time he is sweet and funny and never angry in person but the angry episodes online have become more frequent I have tried standing up a little more for myself which I find very difficult in general or asking for him to be kinder with me but nothing really changes I am beginning to wonder if he is emotionally abusive or not but it is hard for me to tell anything about anything at the moment while I have a lens of depression over everything I think Resisting the cognitive distortion that he hates me like everyone else is already using a lot of my energyTo be honest I could go on all night giving tired rants about this that and the other that is gone wrong in my life or that I hate about myself but I will not bore you with all that Suffice it to say I have got no hope left and I am tired of going through the effort of living everyday I hate that my reaction to anything bad happening now is the urge to cut myself and I have been wishing for death every day for some time now If everyone knew how much I was hurting they would probably treat me better but that is not really the point is itI have decided I will kill myself in 4 days but I do not know how yet I fear death but I do not want to live any moreThank you for reading if you got this far I am sorry I wrote so much it just sort of happened I have had enough,Suicidal
You know how people say there is a lot of stigma around mental health right I am a mental health nurse and I struggle with this shit After helping people for years and just sort of getting by as my relationships crumbled around me and as I felt like I was slipping down more and more into a deep abyssI am finally on the path to getting help for myselfI realized I was in some deep shit when I was on a family vacation Looking around I saw everyone having a great time while on a boat ride Me I just wanted to die and spent the day fighting back tears while thinking why the fuck cannot I enjoy myself What the fuck is wrong with me And why cannot I just be normal A week prior to that moment I was looking off of the edge of a 4 story building waiting for some food at a rooftop restaurant wondering would the jump be enough to end my painWhile I have these thoughts I know I would never act on them In my line of work I have seen what happens when plans go wrong too many times And more often than not it only leads to worse pain and sufferingOn top of that I recently heard of an aquaintance that ended their life and I can see the pain their family is now feeling I would never want to transfer my pain to someone else like thatFor me I have already promised my family that I would never hurt myself I tell my patients all the time you have to find your reason to fight through Whatever your reason is no matter how hard it gets that reason will carry you through to the light of a better day So here I am and my reason has kept me here And now I can finally admit that I need help this is just too big for me to go at it alone My partner was able to help me navigate my most recent crisis and get me set up with a psychiatrist and therapist For which I am so thankfulI avoided this for years despite knowing I needed help I am a psych nurse right I know how to help others fix this sort of thingI should be able to fix myself toorightAnyway I am writing this for everyone here that is struggling To tell you it gets better Find your reason stay strong and most importantly reach out Help is available If you really feel like you are going to hurt yourself go to your local Emergency Room they will be able to help you through the worst and hopefully connect you to resources in your communityFor me right now just taking this little step of admitting I need help and making a plan has given me an unbelievable level of relief Just knowing that I am finally trying to take control over this illness rather than let it control me is liberating I feel like the pressure that was in my head has started to release After months of feeling like shit and years of being down I actually feel somewhat human again rather than this empty void nothingness do not get me wrong I am not 100 cured or better by any stretch of the imagination but I feel like it is a start in the right direction so much so that I was even able to go out for a date with my partner tonight and actually enjoy it I feel so relieved I am finally on my way to starting therapy and getting help for my severe depression and intermittent suicidal ideation,Suicidal

Tips on how to accept my symptoms are just anxiety and start living again The last month has been such a struggle for me I started having panic attacks where my heart rate would spike to 150180 I went to my doctor in case it wasnt anxiety and just had my Holter Monitor results come back I had one of these attacks while on it and thankfully no dangerous rhythms were found Just some high rates but not sustained so my doctor is unconcerned So once again this is all anxiety My therapist thinks its because I started a new job last month and Im falling back into my old health anxiety habits because Stress compounds symptoms This has gotten so bad that the past week I havent even been able to leave my bed out of fear of my heart getting too high Due to probably the fear when I cooked or did dishes my heart rate could get up to 130 then if I noticed and began to worry it went up to 160 Now that I know Im fine I thought Id be okay but Im still constantly watching my smart watch to see how high my heart rate gets then panicking when I see it go above 120 from just walking around the house but when Im calm it doesnt go over like 110 This happened on the Holter and it was normal I know this is just anxiety but I cant stop obsessing that I have a heart issue thatll kill me I just need help to take the smart watch off and stop taking my blood pressure Its just making everything worse Yesterday alone according to my logs I took my blood pressure 50 times I was worried because my bp was low when standing yet my heart rate was high so I thought it was dangerous It happened again this morning and my heart rate got to 165 This constant checking is driving me crazy and ruining my life How do I stop this,Anxiety/Stress

For those who have been there is it possible for you to communicate through text what being suicidal feels like I am sure this is incredibly difficult to relive and if this is to ridiculous of a request I will delete this post immediately But I had a colleague commit suicide and he wrote a very clear and concise letter on Facebook that made me feel like this was his only option He had tried everything from books to professionals he made it seem like that this option was best for him In his letter he almost had me convinced that in this course of action he would finally be at peace Like the title says help me understand Help me understand,Suicidal

So much happened this week and i cant handle myself I am 28 years old and my birthday is tomorrow I am not the one who cares much about my age or celebrates it However i am having a very bad week and seem too stressed out To start with i was on a weekend trip with my girl friends to relax and meet after 2 long years It was fun But i am always the 3rd wheel in that friendship They both are nice to me and they wish well for me But i am the complete opposite of them They are funny crack jokes extrovert and i am none of it I just listen to them and enjoys the company sort of They are good looking and can carry themselves I am bit on the fatty side and does not look much good in the pictures I think it always bothers me Anyways i come back from the trip and thought to stay with my boyfriend for some days I feel lonely even when he is around He gets very excited about his work and talks continuously about it I am very much discouraged and demotivated by it even though i should not He helped with a lot of stuff at work I keep wondering why i am not excited as much as he is I am interested in doing my work but i am not an expert Just an average person at work But i am a team lead too and the management part of comes easily for me I normally handles the new joinee mentorship any documentations managing the team calls setting up sessions Somewhat what a culture team would do I like doing this but i dont want to be known for it Anyways past week my department head called me up and said he sending some names selected for attending a training and asked to review it I thought I might be in it but i was not Every lead except me which made me very sad I do not know why i was not even considered I am not that bad Yet again This all happened when i was still at my boyfriends place I dont think he knows i was struggling with all this negative vibes happening Still i thought i will hold my head high I started going through my drive which the girls uploaded the pics of us I dont normally go through it I thought i might as well because my sister was asking for pics So i selected some which i looked better with them I thought i will send some good ones and some bad ones for the fun of it The moment i send it she replied telling me i look terrible in it That I have put on too much weight and no one would tell this to my face By that point i was breaking down I was crying hard and was feeling so much heavy in my heart I was with my boyfriend and yet he does not know my heart was breaking with all the pain I dont if i should blame him or I should have gone to him May be he does not know i am struggling and i am not willing to tell him my struggles So i texted my sister back yup i know I dont think she know i was upset Then my second sister texted me saying i should take care of my health Our family has diabetes genes She was telling me the same thing I was okay with her msging but i am very upset with the other sister for bitching about my weight I only send pics to her This all happened on Friday At work i did literally nothing I could not do anything I keep thinking about hypothetical scenarios and to wishful thinking if i could just leave everything behind It was so much pain Tomorrow is my birthday and i want to be alonejust alone I dont know what to do I dont know if this birthday is the thing thats making me miserable But honestly i am not worried about getting aged I am just tired I know I should not expect people to come to you But oh man I wish i could have someone who can feel me and i can open up to I know i have people to talk People will listen to me But i cant open up to them Everything is bottled up inside and i am so so stressed and sad and what not I just wanted to write my miseries Hope this helps me,Anxiety/Stress

In March after a year of rejections I finally got my dream job and I was happier than ever Everything was going well but then I lost a few members of my family and took a week off as a result My job acted supportive at the time so I did not think this would affect anything Less than two weeks ago I moved to the city where the job is based cementing this new stage in my lifeAnd today I went into the office just to discover that they are not passing my probation and are terminating my employment immediatelyThis came as such a shock to me as there had been no mention of my performance in the past outside of when I was struggling because of bereavement So it seems like they have this front that they are supportive of people with mental health issues but in reality they do not want to deal with people who have themI am so broken and I do not know what to do I worked so hard to get this job after the pandemic ruined my life and I cannot even get this right My mental health always finds a way to fuck up every good thing in my life and now I am alone in a new city with no jobAll the healing I have done over the last couple of months bc of my bereavement has just disappeared and I am back at square one I feel like my life will never be good and Id rather be dead I cannot take this anymore bc I am a disgusting failure I lost my dream job after working so hard for it and I want to die,Depression

let me start by saying i am in the same boat a all of you i wish i could help you all but i can t sadly about me when i wa 9 something clicked and i started to view the world a a negative place the realization of not being able to form genuine friendship my friend dying and my father not really being there for u this sent me into a depression which i am still in today i won t lie i think about suicide quite often but i control myself by distracting myself with other activity instead of letting the thought get to me all they are are thought and they have become a coping mechanism i have gone through a few therapist and psychiatrist too although i stopped my ssri and adhd med when i wa i then became quite angry knowing there is no escape the day blended together day after day rotting away i became angry with myself and others and became very angry at others and closed minded in no way am i telling you to do anything i wa in a funk this winter and a friend of mine happened to have a gel tab of lsd and i asked to buy it later that night i took it and hopped on discord with a good friend of mine who also ha some of the same stuff going on a me and ha done mushroom so we relate well it wa unexplained the most beautiful feeling i have ever felt to explain it for someone who hasn t done psychedelics it the feeling that you are part of a bigger picture and that every moment ha lead up to this you are loved i am you and you are me i am still having a hard time putting it into word i laughed the hardest i had ever laughed and then realized what life is and started to get in my feeling and cry i cried for a while and hard too and then i thought the situation wa funny and started laughing again because i know wherever i end up i will make it and that life is such a beautiful thing not to be wasted or taken for granted i then went on to trip more time on lsd and twice on mushroom i am not saying go do psychedelics but for me they have done more than ssri ever did for me in the course of a night the feeling of having a clear place in the universe and being able to question with such a reduced sense of fear is amazing the feeling of going with the flow and seeing where life take you is a liberating feeling we were put here to love one another not kill ourselves and waste potential here are my final thought do your research before doing any psychedelic because if you take ssri it could mess you up real bad also i truly believe psychedelics are the way of the way of the future i still have depression yet it is a lot easier to cope with and feel a sense of calmness instead of absolute terror about whatever you are facing know that whatever is bringing you down i love you and the universe doe too you were put here to serve a a part of a much bigger picture just a small piece of a puzzle learn to love yourselves and others and peace will come to you in all aspect of life,Depression

This is such a trite bullshit phrase used by anti suicide peopleThe help people need is often not available The working world rules all and does not give allowances for mental health issues until they demand to be taken seriously usually by some act of irreversible damageIn theory I should have support I see an occupational therapist suspected to have ASDADHD and a counsellor They can try and work through my issues but they cannot do anything to help with the unrelenting stress of my job And I cannot afford to quit Useless I cannot explain any of my issues to my boss They have no power to change my job or provide help Its just not that type of organization It would be humiliating to discuss this with them too Stress leave does not really exist Would have to see a doctor for that They all say they do not know me well enough to recommend leave And it would not help me unless it means a change of job Its useless to talk to my family They cannot do anything practical My dad continually downplays my illness or compared to his own or just thinks I get a little depressed Tells me I should never feel I cannot take a vacation A totally stupid thing to say Talking to them usually just makes me angry Help lines are totally useless Never a practical suggestion I just want to end it to prove a point to my father who does not take me seriously my therapist and OT and pysch and everyone else so they know it was serious I was not faking I really needed help big middle finger to my employer They like to think they are progressive and care about employees mental health I could seriously embarrass them let everyone else know how little they meant to me end this charade of working hard to support a life no longer worth living there is nothing worth the bullshit I put up with Obviously I want help but it clearly does not exist And do not bother reporting concern to Reddit what good does that do Ask for help yeah right from who or what,Suicidal

I have been close to my friend for four years in the friendship I was constantly apologizing for the mistakes that were not my own We got in a lot of fights mostly about respecting each other since he never respected me I made mistakes in the friendships he made some overly bad mistakes I was so scared of losing my friendship it ended up hurting me in the end Throughout the friendship I helped him so much paid for so much bought him things to make him happy and helped him with a girl that he loved for so long just so he could be happy So many things because a part of me thought he was going to be my best friend for life and I was manipulated a lot throughout the friendship Fast forward near our graduation he gave me covid19 and throughout covid 19 my dad passed away when I got symptoms and I had to be locked in a small room throughout and I never got to see my dad in his last moments when he passed I stood in a room shaking and that same idea torments my soul and has just weighed a huge amount of anxiety towards me When I had covid he would not let me tell any of our friends he kept saying how it will ruin the friendship between me and him and others I was threatened and vulnerable during the situation as my dad was currently in the hospital in critical condition The only thing keeping me sane throughout the process that we were still friends and he knew the most about my dad and I could talk to him Throughout this incident a month later he ended up cutting me off for reasons that I regret but summary was he talked shit about me to make people hate me and basically it was a situation between how these people hated eachother and forced it upon me and him and basically the two girls manipulated him the entire time to hate the two girls At the end it switched up on me for the wrong reasons lies were being told In the end my friend basically got mad for bringing up his name and he told me to go kill myself and told me I deserve everything that is happening to me Now it continues that I am losing my other friends I have fallen into depression and he is slowly making everyone hate me The only thing keeping me sane was being able to talk to people and distract myself but nothing has gone good Every single week something worse happens and I just do not want to be on this planet anymore I do not want to go throughout life my life is over my dad is gone and everything is just garbage It comes to the point where I cannot even explain this situation because it is so long and it is so fucked up I just want to be happy again but i will truly never find happiness I do not know how to cope I cannot even talk to my family about it I just hate my life I hate my life and it seems like it is getting worse,Suicidal

Im convinced I have a urethral stricture In may of last year I had a type of explosion in my bladder It came with an insane feeling of urgency frequency and a feeling that my Bladder was in the grip of a vice I also had an electrical type feeling in my bladder and Perineum I saw a urologist who thought I had a urethral stricture I was sent for a cystoscopy that showed everything was ok That was in September 2018 3 months later the urgency and frequency decreased but then what accompanied was pelvic pain tailbone pain I had to start sitting down to urinate and I had to start milking my urethra to empty it at this time I was also tapering from 6mgs of clonazepam I hit 2mgs when this started I finished my taper on clonazepam in the middle of February I now have all of those symptoms but theyre at full force now For the past two weeks I had a slight burn at the end of urination Peeing didnt hurt but at the end I had a sharpburn pain in a specific area in the top of my penisurethra For the past two weeks Ive had a feeling that theres a marble stuck in my urethra Sometimes I can feel pressure in my urethra when I move about Sometimes I get a sharp stabbing pain down my urethra too The side of my penis hurts too I Also have to gently milk my urethra to get the rest of the urine out My fear is that the cystoscopy has caused a stricture Its done the very thing that it was supposed to rule out There was no blood after it was done nor did it burn when I peed but the tip of my penis was very swollen for an Hour or so Apparently its extremely rare for someone to get a stricture from a routine cystoscopy especially in the area I think mine is But Im 100 convinced that I have one Its making me very ill I see the urologist in 5 days time Im in a chronic pelvic pain support group and apparently this is a very common symptom But other guys have the same symptoms and have a stricture I dont want another cystoscopy but Im guessing Ill have to have one as its the only way to treat a stricture I cant believe Im in this mess Im so upset and frustrated,Anxiety/Stress

I do not see anything wrong with suicide anymore I feel like people who are sad about my death could just die as well I do not know how to stop feeling this way I am terrible Absolutely terrible I cannot fucking take care of my own hygiene I cannot fucking take out trash in my room All I do is just play video games I want to plan my death and act on it as soon as possible I do not care what will happen to my family after I die I do not care if it will get better I do not care if there is still things to do Suicide is much easier than trying to fix myself and I am the type of person that takes the easy way out If its a phase or a mood swing I would be even worse of a person than I already am I am disgusted with myself,Suicidal

I am not vegan at all but I have been thinking about this for a while how we just eat other creatures Imagine if aliens came to earth and were absolutely horrified to see us all eating each other with 0 thought or remorse and despite not even needing to We seriously measure an animals worth by how intelligent they are and we think were better than them and worthy of killing and eating them because we were born more intelligent If I suggested eating a human people would be disgusted but I do not understand how its any different If a cow or a pig is food then that means were also just food The reality is that there is 0 difference The only difference is the lack of empathy we have for animals compared to other humans because were selfish and ignorant as fuck as long as it benefits us Were destroying the planet and killing off many species and we still continue to think we are the best because were somewhat intelligent If there was an animal bigger and more intelligant than us and they wanted to eat us we would not like that We would beg them for mercy and that is what these animals would do to but they cannot speak for themselves and literally do not know any better But we sentence millions of animals to that when they are just existing and trying to enjoy lifeI just think there is a lot about the world that is so fucked up but nobody sees it I feel like I see the world for how it really is,Depression

Possibly letting anxiety get to me I am the type of poster that you will hate Im fully aware that I am 90 of the time just blowing everything out of the water with anxiety its been my MO for awhile I was at a bar talking to some women when we had to run my cousin back across the street to the hotel due to him getting into arguments When we came back there were shots on the table for us and I really remember almost nothing after that The only thing I remember is being in a car with one of the ladies and that guy being really grabby from the backseat Woke up at the ladys house the next morning and she dropped me off at my car Ive talked to her since and shes the guy did kiss me when we dropped him off She said you did get out to piss at one point and he followed you out Dont know what happened but you were only gone about 45 seconds and didnt say anything when you got back in That was last Friday nightSaturday morning Its not Sunday and I have been sick as fuck Sore throat head stuffed up probably one of the worst coughs Ive ever had Obviously the first thing that comes to mind to me is HIV As far as Ive been told from her nothing happened that night aside from the kiss part I have since noticed that the condom from my wallet is gone but that honestly could have been gone for awhile before hand I may have just forgotten to replace it I would think if anything else happened I would be a bit sore the next day I obviously know nothing about this person so their status would be unknown to me I know the general consensus will likely be that I am being overly anxious But I know that I will not be able to calm down until I can be tested Apparently HIV RNA tests are able to detect after 11 days The only thing I can find about those is through this site httpswwwstdcheckcomhivrnatestphp And Im not sure how trustworthy that is Thanks in advance,Anxiety/Stress

Aneurysm Fear I was minding my own buisness last night and heading to bed when a sudden pain took over the left side of my forehead Lasted all of about 10 seconds and was abrupt but it did make me go Ow internally The throbbing continued for around 20 or so seconds afterward The event however left me feeling mentally discombobulated I felt so spacy and out of it when moments earlier I had clarity Derealization galore feeling like I wasnt myself or in my own body I was also very sleepy so I fell asleep moments later Today I have pain but only behind my left eye Sure enough Doc Google says that this is an aneurysm and impending death is imminent I cant tell if I have a dilated eye just by looking at it but one pupil is larger than the other although this isnt much of the case when I take a pic with flash on it The pain behind my left eye is more of a nusance than anything extreme Id think that oned know when something this serious was about to erupt no Thats the scary thing about things like this Anyway health anxiety in general has been ruining my life lately,Anxiety/Stress

alright so first i have to admit that my biggest need in life is to feel loved not just loved but to have someone that finds me attractive and is turned on by me and my body including my penis now when i was younger say teen and young adult i really did not care too much about my penis size sure i would be a bit embarressed by it and was always one to hold off on sexual activities until i had been with a girl for a little while but it did not because depression I am in my 30s now and my life experiances has taken me from thinking size is not everything to litterally crying more often then i would like to admit over my penis size I am a grower first off and at full staff its not too bad i guess below average but not micro by any means but soft its less then an inch for sure in fact when I am sitting down its litterally inside me anyway because of this i have never been much for one night stands or to go around having sex with lots of woman with the exeption of twice in my life i have just been a long term relationship type i have had 4 previous relationships one was marriage for almost 10 years and i am on my 5th currently all 4 of those i was cheated on multiple times my ex wife i had even found that she was telling the other guys that i was small and she did not get turned on my it taking something i was already a little self consious about and adding in that EVERY girlfriend i have had has cheated on me i am now VERY needy in terms of exeptence of my penis size my current relationship we have sex once or twice a month and that is it she says she is just not a very sexual person but see we were friends before we started dating and she used to talk about loving to give blowjobs and she even had a FWB just because she loved giving them so much she had someone she could just go suck any time she wanted so i cannot help but feel like its me like i have an underwelling penis that just does not get her going my life at this point revolves around my self loathing over my penis size I feel like the ONE thing i need more then anything i can never have because no girl gets excited about small penis the best i hear is woman that say they do not mind it or that it does not matter to them but i clearly have never even found that i do love my current girlfriend and she is good to me any many non sexual ways and i feel i cannot give my true feelings to her because that might seem like guilt tripping and when it comes to sex guilt tripping someone in many ways is a bit well i cannot think of the word so i will use an example a guy that guilts a woman into sex because she gave him blue balls would be considered a pig right so i feel like if i talked about this with her it would be similar like oh you should have sex with me more because i need to feel like my penis size is ok i just cannot do that i do not feel right about it even if i know in my head that is not my reason in my head I am not doing it as a guilt trip that is still kind of too close to the same category so i sit here so damned depressed that i cannot even take care of myself when i feel the urge sometimes i feel sad and like i will never feel truly loved and desired you know let us talk about porn for a moment i am not one to use it when i am in a relationship but i had a few years between my ex and my current girl to have watched a bit and really dig around to see what is out there and i am starting to cave a bit and use it from time to time just because of how in frequent we have sex but the point of bringing up porn is this there is fetishes for basically everything feet fetishes old people fat people short people tall people big boobs small boobs ect ect i mean the list is endless but you know what i cannot find a porn fetish catagory for woman that like small dicks you can find a fetish for woman that like to be peed on and deficated on but not that like small penis in fact the only small penis fetish i can find is HUMILIATION which is the LAST thing i want to see and just know that its out there depresses me even more its depressing to think that every woman i have ever been with has been so displeased by it that they decided to go find a bigger one to play with on the side i tried anonymous video sites a few times when i was single and that left me crying every time you find a girl that wants to cam with you and as soon as she sees what i am working with she either clicks off immediatly or she stays to laugh and call it small there was one time that i thought that maybe witholding the information that i had a small dick until the relationship was a few weeks old or more was my problem so when i was talking to this one girl i waiting for her to bring up sex in the conversation and when she finally did i informed her i was small she asked for a picture so i sent her one she litterally just stopped replying never heard from her again like i genuinly feel like maybe they feel like they have been scammed or something start a relationship with me i seem like a good boyfriend and then bam small dick i do not know what to do i know i should not put so much into my penis size but my life experiances has caused this and i can no longer convince myself its ok i can no longer believe size does not matter or its the motion of the ocean or that looks are not everything or that you can make up for it in bed with other things like mouth skills and so on i just want someone to genuinly like my penis and i will never have that small member causing major depression,Depression

If any one cares to hear me out I am crying and I feel like venting I am a 26 year old woman with 2 kids 6 and 7 I feel so depressed and completely lost I am married I have been married for 8 years and things just get worse and worse between my husband and I Long story short about infidelity We had problems the first 2 years of marriage and he decided to bring one of his ex lovers to my house while I worked nights at the hospital He said they only kissed but I could not get over it so I started talking to this guy and I kissed him but we never had sex He hit me ten times harder and ever since he hardcore cheated on me around 3 times with 3 different women He left me last year after we had fixed most of our issues and I was shocked he left because I thought we were OK He started talking to this woman and he shamed me and my body and put me down so bad He later apologized and said he made a big mistake and I took him back We been back for about 8 months and he treats me worse than ever The other day my car broke down in the middle of a busy street and I had my kids in the back he came to help me and told me to pop the hood I could not find the button I guess I was nervous He yelled at me so bad and called me stupid and so many names He said I was an idiot and I should go seek help for my mental problem Someone almost crashed me and the kids and I felt so scared Instead of making me feel better he made me feel terrible My mom tells me to leave him and go live with her but I do not want to go back with her I had a terrible childhood with her and my dad Although they are separated I still would not want to go live with my Mom and step dad My mom is extremely religious and told me that If I go back I have to stick to her religion and marry a man from the religion and I will be restricted to hang with world people which are normal people outside the religion and I would not go live with my Father because he is a narcissist who emotionally abused me my mom and sister Also was violent most of the time I cannot run to my sister because she is emotionally bruised too living with severe depression My aunt advised me to use my husband and finish my college degree and get a job and leave him but sometimes I feel like I am no smart enough to do this A lot of questions come to my mind like what if I am not smart enough to finish school and get a job Sometimes I just want to runaway and leave him but I have no where to run to I feel so lost and depressed he is a narcissist as well Not as terrible as my dad but sure reminds me of him I feel lost and broken and I have no other family to rely on I have seeked professional help but It did not help much I do not know what to do I just sit and cry and cry sometimes I cannot stop the tears I feel like I am a weak person I constantly ask my self why cannot I toughen up why am I like this my self esteem is all time low I do not know what to do anymore Depressed and feeling lost CALIFORNIA,Depression

How I am almost over my Health Anxiety Quick intro 3 years a go I had an incident in the shower that mimicked a stroke I came out of it unharmed but it messed me up psychologically Ever since then my body takes any feeling it gets and goes into panic mode Now i hate driving i hate taking a shower i hate exercising You name it if i makes me hot i get anxious At onc point i was so anxious showering i had to sit down and hold on for dear life the entire time i was in there Now im about 80 over it and form my experience the only way over it is to go through it And what i mean by that is you need to face this demon head on I know its the last thing you want to hear but trust me If you never face it you will be running forever However it will take time for your brain to rewrite its default path ways So at the moment the default behavior is fear and to curl up and say please dont hurt me So your brain interprets it as a threat and will spiral out of control causing all sorts of symptoms the worst of which being a panic attack Now next time you start getting the fear coming on try this instead Say to your fear out loud Just kill me then Bring it on Lets see what you can do and taunt your fear and let what ever you think is going to happen happen by wanting the what ever it is you are afraid of to happen will make the fear vanish Another thing to think If you were to say have a heart attack it would just happen whether you worried or not Worrying isnt going to some how miraculously save you At my lowest the turning point for me was when i just thought id rather be dead than to feel like this anymore and from then on i basically laid down my life to my fear and said just kill me Kill me now or shut the fuck up I needed to hit rock bottom so I could rebuild my brain the right way and for a few weeks i just kept saying Kill me now or shut up over and over until my brain started using the new default behavior It can take months to retrain your brain and then add years on that to fully forget but this is what is working for me TLDR Taunt your fear egg it on call it out ask it to do its worst even if it kills you Let it flow through you and out the other side I bet nothing bad happens TLDR 2 If you were going to die it would just happen whether you worried or not Worry isnt going to some how miraculously save you,Anxiety/Stress
I know this may sound bizarre but personally I will rather die at a young age than at an old age I do not want to spend all of my life going through pain depression and mood swings I have made stupid mistakes and sins so what is the point of keep living until you reach to the old age when you can just end now without having to wait for a long time I may not kill myself but I do want to die For now I am thinking about getting shot in a head a robber hoodlum or any criminal that will later get caught one day hence Ill die a young age I do not want to die an old age Its too long and it just does not feel right since I love to be young and youth Ill rather die young than to die an old age,Suicidal

some backstory i have crohn s disease but am currently in remission so physically and health wise i ve been doing well the combination of medication that i m on seem to be doing their job and overall i feel pretty good so over the last year and a half or so i ve developed this awful anxiety habit of being terrified that i m suddenly going to get sick and need to shit and not be able to find a bathroom when i m out and about and it s taken a toll on my everyday life i can not leave the house for work in the morning without returning the bathroom sometimes more time before i finally work up the courage to get out the door because i m terrified that somewhere along my minute commute i m going to feel the urge and not be able to get to a bathroom fast enough the thing is if i m just at home all day i likely will only have to shit probably once but if i even think about leaving the house i instantly have to go to the bathroom if i have plan i have to schedule my day around how much time im going to need to spend in the bathroom before i can leave i have to feel like i ve emptied out a much a possible before i can get in the car i don t even hang out with friend or date anybody anymore because the stress of this situation is just too much taking my kid to the beach or the park ugh if i m not 00 positive there will be a public restroom available there we aren t going and i hate that it s not only affecting me but thing like that are and will continue to affect my daughter if i don t get a grip on it soon another example of this is i have the opportunity to send her to a much better school and one of the thing that s holding me back is i m terrified of what morning drop off will look like that i don t think there s bathroom available for parent to access during those time the business around the school aren t open that early to access it start earlier so i ll have to leave earlier to drop her off thus leaving me le time to sit on the toilet before we head out etc etc it feel so stupid but to me it s so real i don t even know how to really put it all into word the anxiousness i feel about it it s such a weird thing that i don t really know how to talk to anyone about because i ve never met someone else with this kind of issue doe anyone else struggle with this i feel like i don t even remember what life felt like before i developed this weird anxiety around it my life feel like it revolves around knowing where the bathroom is sorry for the long post this wa kind of a looking for support asking for help needing to vent post thanks for reading if you got this far sorry i rambled on a bit i don t even know where to start,Depression

Ever since the UK had a large country lockdown thing last year my social life has gotten worse and sometimes I cannot even speak as I do not know what to say Recently I have been getting more persistent suicidal thoughts and wanting to self harm Thankfully my addiction to the internet has basically saved my life as I have found out what phobias are Me having a phobia of death and pain really saves me from doing anything to hurt myself Though at times I get SERIOUS thoughts but I try and consider the good things in life and turn to them for helpAnother problem is that me and my parents have completely different views on mental health I think it is looked down upon to be mentally unstable and it should be talked about more my mum is a nurse who thinks she knows everything but she most certainly does not and lastly the worst of all my dad He tells me that I should not cry because its annoying anxiety is a stupid thing and it is all just a phase that I am not depressed I am just being a teenager Speaking of what he says I am scared of him because he would shout at me all the time when I was little sometimes It was justified most of the time it was not and he tells me that I should be scared he just does not understand that children are not supposed to be scared of their dads Sorry this is long but NEXT Unfortunately on the subject of suicide I have attempted to commit suicide It was a couple months ago when I was in the bath I was listening to some what I call Lucid Dreaming sort of music and my family was downstairs watching the TV and nobody had checked on me in a while Since my mum is always worrying because she knows I struggle with self harm thoughts I was wondering why she is not shouting up to me asking if I am okay It kind of just made me feel unwanted as all my family where laughing downstairs whilst this suicidal kid was in a bath by themselves they could possibly decide to like end it all Suddenly I was just looking back on all the times I felt empty and I realised how much I was feeling that numb feeling I just decided to sink beneath the water It was not until reality set in that I ended up surfacing and thinking it all over I do not think some people would class this as an attempt but I think it isI know this is long I know I am sorry I just have a lot to say that I cannot say out loud or I am going to get grief Some things wrong with my life,Suicidal

Convinced I have MRI contrast dye poisoning weeks after a brain MRI Need help coping Using a somewhat new throwaway account sorry if my karma is low Im sort of new to the realization that I have HA but it all makes sense now Ive always had anxiety but its definitely evolved into this about 6 months ago A few months back I had some strange symptoms that were related to jaw pain Ive pretty much figured out whats wrong there but because of that Ive seen a slew of doctors including a neurologist My doctor ordered a brain MRI with contrast just to be safe I stupidly googled if the contrast dye can cause adverse reactions in people I strongly suggest you dont google it Anyway after the MRI I felt nauseated which set my HA into a tailspin Now a few weeks later Im noticing that my feet hands and legs suddenly go cold especially when Im sitting down Im talking freezing cold even if the rest of my body is warm When they finally warm up I get pins and needles all down my legs and today I woke up with muscle spasms in my feet and legs My scumbag brain is telling me I have some type of weird contrast dye poisoning that isnt curable you know how it goes My feet getting freezing cold does happen when Im not in what I would say would be a heightened state of anxiety It usually sends me into a state of anxiety which Im sure definitely doesnt help my extremities Its a real chickenegg scenario Does this sound like anxiety to anyone or should I actually be concerned I mean Im young just turned 30 I exercise about 4 or 5 times a week I eat pretty healthy and am all around healthy In my mind this should not be happening but here I am Im also worried that if I go to the doctor and ask him to test to see if I still have the dye in my system hes going to think Im crying wolf and wont take me seriously when something else is wrong I definitely need the sage advice of other HA veterans Im new to this and dont know how to tell my brain to stop worrying about it It wont and I feel out of control like I cant shut it off,Anxiety/Stress

I need advice on what to do with my Enlarged Spleen ampx200B In early december I found out that I have an enlarged spleen after MANY trips to the ER and being sent home because I was having a panic attack which I have never had before Finally after probably over 10 visits I got a Doctor who believed me and got me appointments within days At the time I thought it was my heart I had a stress test done and a echocardiogram they said my heart was in really good condition We also discovered I had a high Ddimer and was sent for a CT scan for a pulmonary embolism which was clear too My Ddimer has come down since to around 511 much better but not super I then got a ultrasound of my gut because they thought maybe it was my galbladder which was fine they did however find out that my spleen was enlarged it was something like 135 cm so not super enlarged it is still enlarged and it effects my daytoday life For example I cannot lie down on that side or cannot eat too much or it gets aggravated I have been tested for Mono it was clear I have just recently 2 days ago gotten my mirena removed I need to illiminate all possibilities no matter how small and he has put me on a high dose of 2 different antibiotics There is nothing left that I can think of that could enlarge my spleen besides cancer or some sort of virus that has not been found Other symtoms I am having currently I have a cough but I am getting a cold now However I have had a dry couch since november I can feel my nodes in my neck and they are really uncomfortable if touched or I turn my head in a funny way Inside my left ear hurts occassionally as well as my left side of my jaw sort of where the ear pain meets my jaw The nodes in my armpits occassionally hurt too And sometimes my hands have a sort of aching pain as if I used them for something hard and the muscles were healing The doctor keeps telling me to relax and enjoy my upcoming trip and enjoy life but WTH Everything I have read online says AN ENLARGED SPLEEN IS NOT NORMAL I dont know where to go from here I need help advice Something I am Canadian if that makes a difference Thank you if you have gotten this far,Anxiety/Stress

Decrease stress by ADDING a hormetic stressor into your life One of the best ways to decrease how much total stress you experience is by adding good forms of stress short and moderate called hormetic stressors Cold water is a prototypical hormetic stressor It releases stress hormones like adrenaline and noradrenaline but it is short and not extreme We just launched an app that provides guided cold showers to make it easy for you to do them It is led by a Master Chief Navy SEAL We teach you a set of mental tools around tactical breathwort body relaxation self talk etc These tools not only make cold showers easier but they also help you handle stress more generally In fact the best way to train yourself to handle stress better is to systematically stress yourself and then practice these tools while stressed If you do that these tools will become reflexive any time your body generates stress hormones getmentalcom One side note the app is geared generally to men,Anxiety/Stress

I should start by saying that I know I have a blessed life My parents are still together and love me and my siblings unconditionally I live in a developed country where there is no war My parents paid for all my college and I was a great student I got a job 1 month after graduation and never lost itAll of this just makes me feel shittier about the absolute mess that is the inside of my headI worry about my mother dying on a daily basis she is a workaholic with a terrible autoimmune disease When I was younger my grandmother told me I needed to force my mother to go to the doctor otherwise she was not going to go and I was going to let her die she is been going lately And that is all the more worrying because I know that means she cannot handle it by herself anymore Despite working hard all her life she also realised this year she will never be able to afford to move to a house with any of the things she is always wanted for us She often cries saying that she wishes we did not live in this cramped apartment even though me and my siblings are fine with it My heart breaks for her and I cannot do anything about it My grandmother had several strokes these last two years She stayed with us until it was impossible for us to keep her here She went to live with my uncle and was mistreated by them she is now in a nursing home and cries every time I talk to her on the phone She has lost most of her ability to speak but her brain is still OK so she gets incredibly frustrated at her body and her situation I want her to keep living but at the same time I think about how I will off myself before I am ever in the same situation as herI am in my late twenties and I have had anxiety and depression since I can remember I never did well socially I am an averagelooking person and I am intelligent and funny in that sarcastic way so I did have a few admirers mostly of the creepy kind and some superficial friends but I was also the forgettable person In high school the group of people I walked home with made plans in front of me without ever inviting me They did not even pretend to be sorry about it This is also my fault I act nice and I am a peoplepleaser because I do not like confrontation as it makes life harder but I never really care about anyone I do not miss people when I am not with them I never get texts and I barely have any phone numbers on my phone Just my very close family I have never kissed or dated anyone At the same time I am so incredibly lonely because I cannot connect with anyone that I often cry myself to sleep over itAt work I am regarded as a highperformer despite the fact that I have recently slept entire morningsafternoons when I should have been working now that I am WFH I just lie through my teeth during the morning standups My coping mechanism is just shutting down and sleeping so that is what I do It sometimes gets to a point where I cannot tell what is reality or dream I have a very stressful job I am doing the work of 6 people since the team was reduced and then all the more senior people left The previous knowledge the team had was also lost so I struggle to figure it out by myself This job is totally unrelated to any of my majors 2 that I took just because I did not know what I wanted to do and it is a meaningless okpaid deadend job I have looked for other things but there is nothing I feel completely trapped in this job my parents house where I cannot make any decisions but cannot move because I cannot afford to and perpetually worried about my family I look into the future and I just see the same or worse And each day I get more tired of this faade Last year I almost opened the car door and threw myself in the middle of the highway I have been thinking about this more and more frequently I now think about this every day I am just wondering what the point of continuing with this is I live through all of this just so I can have maybe one day per month or less where I get to do what I want to do and to be happy I cannot bear the thought that I will have to live another 40 years of this I do not have the courage to off myself directly but throwing myself off a cliff a bridge or in the middle of traffic sounds wonderful I just want peace in my head I feel trapped,Suicidal

Previous post I went to a big BBQ with family and friends which usually means drinks and someone with a vape pen I did not partake in either and I have to say that I am really proud of myself The good feeling I have is definitely motivating and in a small way I feel like I have a purpose these days by just making it through without those things I remember feeling similarly when I quit cigarettes I would remind myself that even if I was having a shit day I was not smoking and that was good enoughI went to therapy today and told my therapist about how I have been actually feeling BETTER finally I was happy to tell her that I am feeling more like myself I do not know whether I should give credit to the med change or the absence of drinkingsmoking but we figured that there is no need to figure that out just yet I just need to roll with it for now I hope that this feeling lasts DAY 6 of doing the right thing,Depression

TW Sexual AssualtI SAd my friend and I feel absolutely disgusting I am not asking for absolution nor does my POV and context of the situation excuse what I did I am asking what I should do as I cannot live with the fact I did this especially as I was already suicidalI went out with friends and invited a friend I met on a dating app that I had known previously and was in town visiting we got drunk and since she drove I told her she could stay at my place prior to this night I had recently reconnected with friends after disappearing for months during a mental health episode and things looked up for onceThis Is where I completely fuck up and I cannot believe I did this After drinking with some friends at my place we cuddle and put on a movie we were all over each the entire night prior to being drunk too she specifically told me she did not want to have sex because she was going through a lot and recently attempted I genuinely wanted to respect that and not make her uncomfortable so at this time I accepted nothing would happen although I did hope in the back of my head something would We were cuddling and she told me she would take off her shirt because it was hot I told her I understand and that I did not want to make her do anything she did not want to although in the end I did She then said that that makes her want to do it more have sex and I insisted I did not want to make her do anything she is uncomfortable with I should have stopped everything here in retrospect but given I was also intoxicated but its not an excuse She layed on me and I played with her chest we then told each other some pretty vulnerable stuff like how I am a virginShe said things like I cannot believe someone as handsome and amazing as you has not been with anyone etc I told her I have a lot of trauma that made me shy around girls I am not entirely sure what happened next but we made out a little and she ended up laying over my legs on her stomach I assumed she wanted to watch the movie I began touching her more aggressively and took off her underwear the entire time I did not realize she was passed out asleep I thought she may have closed her eyes because as I touched her more intimately but never putting anything inside her she started to breath heavier In hindsight should have not took this as consent I stopped to get up and saw her eyes were closed so I put a blanket over her it still did not click what I had doneShe then asked a couple seconds after tucking her in why she had no underwear I immediately realized what I had done was not consensual I started to apologize the best I could while intoxicated But she was still half asleep After apologizing profusely and waking her up she became very empathetic telling me that it was okay and she will not tell anyone and that I did not know she was asleep I tried to tell her that it does not matter what I did was fucked up but somehow ended up with her embracing me and encouraging me to talk about the trauma I mentioned to her earlier so I did it was weirdly therapeutic and I was so confused because I just did something horrible to herShe ended up sobering up and to my protest she drove and I bought her food and told her how sorry I was agin and if there was anything I can do let me know before she dropped me back at my place I stupidly texted her after not sleeping at all that She should let me take her on a proper date because she said she wanted to see each other before she left town I know I am a stupid idiot but I texted her that she obviously declined and I knew she felt differently than when it initially what happened as she was probably sobering up and processing what happenedI told her I understand and that it was selfish of me to ask She then sent me a longer text later in the day and it was that she felt violated and that I took advantage of her which I absolutely did Despite that She told me that she genuinely thinks I am a good friend and hopes I thrive one day and get help but that she has to block me for her own mental health I replied with a really long apology that I hope was sincere and understanding but it did not go through as I was expectingI am not sure what to do now I have been a mess the entire day I feel so fucking horrible for what I did its eating me alive I was already pretty suicidal and had a really bad view on myself but I am not sure how I can move forward from this as I feel I do not deserve to I did something I cannot forgive myself for and Ibe already been Suicidal for a while NSFW,Suicidal

Think about it assisted suicide is practiced in some areas for physical pain And as I learn more about mental health it is a fact that emotional pain can be felt at the same degree as physical pain So does not it just make sense to give us mentally disturbed folks that relief tooAnd what are we to say to the people who have kept pushing and pushing through the pain for years some their whole life What do we say to them It gets better is a laughable response at that point I am sorry does not solve anything For many of us suicide is not an emotional response it is a logical one In my opinion there is a point where suicide just makes sense,Suicidal

I posted a couple times here a couple of months ago about feeling suicidal and trying to kill myself It finally came out at a friends house last night and I admitted I tried to hang myself in April and my friend was incredibly shocked and comforting I had been thinking all my friends hated me and to get the opposite response and finally be able to tell someone was so so great it feels like a weight last been lifted I worried about telling anyone for so long so I just wanted to say if you have a trusted friend then talk to them they hopefully will understand I also told her I had been raped when I was 15 and it was only this year I realised it was rape which probably contributed to my mental health issues and part of me still thought it was my fault and to hear it was not and be validated was another weight off I had told nobody else about this at the time Talking can help I finally told a friend and it was a complete weight off,Suicidal

Becoming hyperaware of your existence and feeling dissociated Ill add a little background first im a 35 year old male and have never had any diagnosed conditions or health problems in general I have always been extremely shy social health anxiety low confidence never had a girlfriend no friends since I moved to a different part of the country when I was about 22 Over time I think I have been able to numb it down creating explanations and reasonings in my mind and used video games as an escape For the last 10 years or so my life have been ampx200B Wake up and eat breakfast Go to work Come home and shower Make and eat dinner Some kind of workout Sit at computer Sleep and repeat Every other weekend I visit my mom who I spend quality time with and help out since she has a condition that keeps her from doing many things herself ampx200B But a week ago i was hit like a truck with massive depression and anxiety realizing what my life have been these last 10 years I feel like I have wasted so much time especially on the weekends where I was at home doing nothing instead of going to my mom or just doing anything productive I got thoughts about existential dread death and what our purpose really is I got crushing anxiety about my mom dying and me not spending enough time with her and also because she is the only person in the world that truly knows me understands me and that I can be myself with ampx200B I feel like an alcoholic over 10 years who just suddenly stopped drinking from one day to the next now the video games do nothing for me I cant escape and Im lost for purpose My appetite is very unstable and my mind is racing especially when I try to sleep which has led to sleepless nights with my heart racing in panic and having constant disaster thoughts that I cant stop I keep thinking Am I sick Am I going insane Do I have a brain tumor and many more thoughts of that kind I also get this weird feeling somethimes of being disconnected or dissociated to the world I become hyperaware of my existence and my actions and thoughts and it makes everything feel weird In this state I feel like im acting like myself when Im with others like Im something unexplainable controlling this physical body or seeing the world from a 3rd person view Has anyone else experienced this or gone though something similar ampx200B I have started on antidepressant and anxiety medicine and started seeing a psycologist but just wanted to share in hopes of getting some feedback or tools to combat these things,Anxiety/Stress

I have been researching NDEs near death experiences and suicide methods for weeks I read dozens of accounts of NDEs to try and piece together what happens in the afterlife From what I gathered most people who died felt at peace but the few who ended up in dark places stuck with me and now I am afraid to kill myself but I still desperately want to die a peaceful death I figured I would dedicate my life to making others feel good so when I do die I am in a nice place But I cannot even do that right I have spent days in bed and when I do interact with people I am giving them attitude being moody and stressing them out I am broke my business failed which was not my fault and do not know how to function in society anymore I have things going for me but nothing makes me happy anymore and I do not have the same drive that I used toAnyway I ordered my supplies only to find the gas I planned to use is diluted and likely would not kill me Now I am annoyed and embarrassed that I have a useless tank in my closet I know what I wantto diebut with the unknown and the pain I will because I just do not know what to do I want to kill myself but I am afraid of Hell,Suicidal
Am I okay The truth is I am not sure I know what that means anymore Not sure that I ever have known What I know is that my definition of okay and someone elses definition of okay are probably astronomically different Am I okay that is the question my wonderful fianc asked me I lie at first telling them I am That is not who I want to be with them though so I immediately correct myself I am not but I will be I know they think I shut myself off to them when I am this down and they are not wrong It is not for wanting to It is not for not trusting them when I am this emotionally vulnerable it is for not being able to find the words quickly enough as they stumble from my clumsy mouth Writing it all out gives me time to process every single word It allows me to shut my emotions off as I try to explain the roller coaster that is my brain If I were to attempt to vocally explain what I am feeling right now my emotions would consume me and I would just become a sobbing messI have been thinking about who I am lately and honestly I feel like there is not much to me I am average in basically all aspects of myself Underwhelming in some even I feel like I cannot keep the attention of anyone other than my fiances and even then I do not see how I keep theirs I see no other words to describe how I feel about myself other than boring and useless Nothing they have done has made me feel that way but it is my crippling intrusive thought of the week I suppose that is something I struggle with My brain will conjure some sorrowful imagery of myself and I will fixate on it until I believe it true I know therapy would benefit me greatly but I guess my lack of enthusiasm to get that ball rolling is an indicator of my selfish personality All I can think about is how terrifying it would be to spill myself wide open to a stranger Face to face is the issue of course seeing as I have no problem with letting you all read me The thought of even attempting eye contact with a small bald man at my local mental health service makes me want to assume the fetal position In quotations because its an income based establishment in the south they are here to help me as long as they do not have to respect my pronouns Another thing that terrifies me is the fact that there is likely an entirely different person under the layers of trauma and depression that have been festering inside me since I was about five years old What are they like Are they a person my fiance could even love Are they a person I could love I am so accustomed to hating myself that the thought of loving myself makes the threat of a panic attack tingle down my spine The two main things that scare me the most and they are both about me I am not just living for myself anymore though I am with someone who deserves the best version of me possible As bleak as the weather in my mind seems to stay the love and patience they have given me through all of my seasons makes becoming that person seem achievable AnywayI believe my spoons are all used up because I have hit a wall even though I had so much more to say It took a lot from me to write this all out but at least I feel a little more okay now Am I okay,Depression

I am not shure if this is the right sub for this but i have to write this down somewhereI am a 18 year old male avererage reddit user from GermanyAbout a year ago I wanted to upgrade my Pc and accidently broke it The problem in having summer vacation close to no friends and being unable to do your two only hobbies is you have time to think A LOT of time to think After about two weeks of doing nothing except of thinking about my past actions and reflecting about my current state of having about 12 friends ig I am still not shure what a friend really is where do you draw the line severly performing under my possibilities and nearly failing my Abitur Highschool my mood went downwards fast After 4 weeks when I finally got my parts to fix the PC the damage was already done On a daily basis my mood got worse over time I enjoyed my hobbies less and less got less talk active which you can see on this post I usually do a lot and ate less and less to the point of loosing about 10kg in one week which is unhealthy but I am overweight so its not that big of a deal because everything tasted bland anyways and I felt empty anyways I noticed early where that is going to go but was shure after the lastfinal school trip in which i had basically a breakdown once a day I kept going anyways because I did not want anyone to worry but at the same time I wanted exactly that I wanted to see that people actually care about me not because they had to because they are related or care about everyone I wanted to see if somebody actually noticed that I am not okay and not just moody Spoiler nobody did apart from maybe my teacher that noticed that i basically went from the most active student in the course to the least active I cried almost every day Nobody noticed my mom just thought i wanted to loose weight My 18th birthday was about that time I wanted to skip it both my parents divorced did not allow it So i had two partys one with my mom my aunt and my best friend and one with my dad gradparents brother and my dads patchwork family Both were stressing me out strongly all human interaction was hard I wanted to appear kind of ok even though the suicidal thoughts slowly crawled in my head more and more I still hoped anybody notices A few weeks later i was so instable that a simple test in school basically broke me to the point of not even being able to uphold my facade in school that is where I drew the line I cannot wait anymore for somebody to help if I will not help myself now I would possibly do something really stupid later I went to my doctor I expected to get told I was overreacting and should calm down My doctor took me very serious he calmed me down took some test to check if there was a non hormonal because and prescribed me antidepressants and wrote me sick for the day and tge day after it was thursday and the second lockdown was the week after anyways That day was the worst i basically had to tell my mostly oblivious relatives that I was depressed and i had to decide if I would actually use the drugs I had gotten After talking with my parents and people I knew I came to the conclusion that I have no real alternativ than taking them I found a psychologist about 12months later way faster than I expected After about half a year of sucessful medication and therapy my psychologist said they are thinking I would not need therapy anymore I agreed I talked to my doctor and quit the meds I finished school with a grade better than expected I thought it was over itBut the whole time I knew the only goal I had in finding somebody who cared was unfulfilled I have not found one person that cared about me I had to get myself out of there even though that was the only thing i wanted not to do It haunts me I had two medium breakdowns this week I am am fucking scared I do not want to be depressed again I cannot go through that shit again I do not know what to do anymore Everything turned out fine why am I going down the same fucking road i went about a year ago Why do I feel like I am not even worth getting cared about I can study what I want everything went far better than expected why tf is my mood getting worse I just do not know anymore I do not know anymore,Depression

HA for two weeks just discovered what its like Hi all So the last two weeks have been a ride for me Ive always had a buildup of wax in my left ear runs in the family A few weeks ago I noticed a ringing noise in my left ear I went to the doctor and they said it was an ear infection So I started taking antibios didnt go away So today I went to an ENT who suctioned out my ears and gave me stronger antibiotics and reaffirmed me that this is most definitely a temporary phenomenon and will go away in time 1 week 1 hour 1 month he said ears take awhile to heal I had this confirmed by many of my friends that experienced ear infections as well The ringing will go away just in time The problem is throughout the past several days I spent the majority of my time convincing myself that I had some sort of major illness The first concern was cancer then that turned into a meningiti then that turned into inner ear concerns then that turned into HIV concerns I dont know how I arrived at any of these conclusions I had no symptoms of any of these illnesses yet I immediately assumed that I had them No way do I have meningitis I would know by now no way do I have cancer it doesnt really run in my family nor do I display any other symptoms No way do I have aids I have not exposed myself in any way that would put me into a situation where it was possible My friends and peers are all convinced I have anxiety issues and need to see a counselor I went to one last week and she pretty much confirmed that I have anxiety issues that are beginning to manifest themselves in a moderate form of hypochondria I literally started checking myself every day for things lumps rashes bruises I write because Im curious to know other peoples stories How do you cope with this This constant anxietydriven fear of having a major disease Ive spent so much time over my break from school researching illnesses conditions symptoms trying to connect the dots from anything I could have possibly been exposed to in the past The slightest itch would terrify me An ingrown hair on my beltline convinced me I had an STD In effect I didnt actually live the past week My worrying sapped away from my actual living Sorry for the long drawn out rant,Anxiety/Stress

Constant anxiety and have lost feelings for partner Okay so theres a lot for me to go through here and I have to apologise as it is hard for me to explain things as its hard for me to even understand whats going on in my brain Ive been with my partner now coming up to 2 years in May wonderful healthy relationship where there are no issues whatsoever Ill preface this by saying I have struggled with mental health on and off throughout my life mainly being anxiety so I have been on Fluoxetine anti depressants for the last 2 years this has been great for me and has helped me to regulate my emotions and feelings quite well and to what I believe has helped my relationship with my partner to flourish and I have felt genuinely happy Anyway cutting to now Since the very very start of the year just after new years obviously I noticed a lot of anxiety although it may of been creeping in a few weeks before It was as though now I felt it full blast and my inner voice kept telling me that my boyfriend was interested in someone else and I was then getting strong feelings of them cheating although there was no indication of this I think on new years eve I had noticed my boyfriend getting on well with his mates and watching one of his friends who is a girl sing hes a musician and i know the following sounds daft believe me so the next day I kept getting intrusive thoughts of that moment and feeling very sensitive around it as Im quite insecure and never sing and I know my boyfriend would love it if I came out my shell more in that way although hes always telling me how perfect I am It kept going through my mind that he should be with someone like that fast forward a few days Im still feeling VERY on edge and feel incredibly anxious when my boyfriend isnt really showing me that much affection or is in his room for long periods of time I get very panicky and cant seem to calm myself until I go upstairs to see what hes up to if hes just sat there on his phone with his door shut I assume that hes not wanting to be with me even though I think having our own space is healthy and have never had an issue with it before after seeing him just sat there Ill get incredibly upset and more anxious and feel very emotional may even start crying and its difficult to stop I suddenly view my boyfriend very differently Ill also mention now that I was never like this at any other point of our relationship I just started feeling this intense anxiety since new years also Ill mention that Im a very sensitive person and feel as though I pick up on other peoples emotions very easily and that I do that a lot with my boyfriend if he is feeling down about himself etc I also feel these emotions As the days went on I stopped getting these anxious feelings when he wasnt always around but still felt bad anxiety and feeling depression creeping in as the days progressed I noticed myself becoming more sensitive to things and even hyperaware think thats the word which would cause more anxiety for me my boyfriend may say something and I would take it in a negative way and feel offended by it and it would cause a lot of hurt and then anxiety is even worse I would have a lot of moments of just emotional outbursts of crying and finding it difficult to stop just feeling very overwhelmed and so uncomfortable in how im feeling even gagging from what felt like stress and not being able to eat Im feeling this pretty much everyday the past month and a bit Ive been having internal thoughts such as I dont love you and other horrible things directed at my boyfriend which cause me so much anxiety and even more stress as I try to convince myself they are just thoughts and not real having suddenly no feelings towards him getting irritated at little things but still feeling intensely sad over the thought of him with someone else this person is perfect in my eyes and I love all the things about them that are considered imperfections where have my feelings gone Its been over a month and Im scared they wont return because I know this relationship when Im not feeling this way is so good for me and has been the best thing for my life Ill quickly mention that Im 23 now and had a relationship when I was 14 that brought a lot of the very same feelings up but this happened very early on in the relationship a month or so with much breaking up and getting back together due to my anxiety and depression Im sorry for the essay but its really hard to fit everything in but this is just the summary of it Please can I get real responses with this I really want to make this relationship work and stop this anxiety and emotional stress and be able to feel these feelings again for my partner Id hate to think that its over now,Anxiety/Stress
Like wow Think of suicide everyday for the past year Half that year was chronic suicidal thoughts I decided I wanted end my suffering I went online and bought the drug It arrived I have it in my hands its easy access All it takes is a little and I will not even know I am dead Thinking to myself wow its that easy huh And then I am dead which makes suffering no longer existent Everything is fine now But no its much more hard than that You have the permanent solution in the palm of your hands all you have to do is take it and your desire is met I came to realize I do not want to die I just want to end my suffering Thinking of suicide and a plan is a walk through a walk When presented with the permanent solution in your hands it becomes the most difficult thing ever to commit,Suicidal
I want to be able to deal with these feelings and move on Ive talked briefly to a counsellor on the phone but besides talking about it making me cry it hasnt made me feel better This is one of the worst PTSD episodes of my life I cant predict how long this is going to go on and Im sick of the weak dissolving feeling I get whenever I think about it Ive been trying to replace bad thoughts with good Ive tried CBT techniques Ive tried wallowing in the bad thoughts as advised by someone over at remetophobia nothing has worked Im a mess,Anxiety/Stress
paranoid about testicles and now Im freaking out So Im totally serious here and I know it sounds like Im trying to be funny but Im not A week ago I was lazy and didnt do laundry so I went commando for pretty much a week Because of how loose it was down there I became more aware of my testicles and would reach down there more often Anyways because I was constantly reaching down there I became paranoid about my testicles I should also note that I was a frequent fapper like 34 times a day and decided to stop that So I would go nofap for 2 days and then have a go at it once the next day Then again 2 days not and then on the 3rd day have a go at it I started this 2 weeks ago and last week I felt a little pinch on my left testicle It didnt hurt or anything it was just uncomfortable but went away fairly quickly but that feeling only heightened my paranoia I havent felt that feeling since but I keep thinking about it and now I keep imagining I do have that feeling again I always constantly reach down there feeling them and thinking omg one is bigger than the other omg one feels softer than the other Im dying I want to go to the doctor but I also have a fear of doctors I cant sleep Im undereating I sometimes cry at night I was never like this and I hate it Last year I was paranoid about my neck which took me a while to get over and now its below the belt I just want to live my life normally again,Anxiety/Stress

I thought I was getting better with my depression and self harm but everyday seems to be slowly getting worse and worse and I do not know how much longer I can deal with it My only friend will not talk to me and I have no one else to go to about my problems My mom has been doing some semiabusive things for a while now and as much as it is not abuse it still makes me feel bad and only makes it worse She always points out my insecurities and makes jokes about my trauma She never listens to anything I say and she gets mad over everything where I feel scared to even leave my room She will not let me see my therapist anymore she threw away my ADHD anxiety and depression medication and refuses to get more She pretty much neglects how I am feeling physically and mentally 247 and there is nothing I can do about it because she is the adult in my life I feel unsafe in my home and I just want to go somewhere else I want to be admitted to a mental hospital and get help but every time I bring the subject up my mom tells me I am fine she is not spending her money on that and to just stop being so attention seeking The only way I could live without her was if I went to live with my dad but he already struggles with money ever since my parents divorced and my mom kicked him out I doubt he would be able to provide for himself and a kidkids But I feel so hopeless and stressed out all I want is to feel free and I have been contemplating suicide nonstop I do not want to die I just want to be happy but I just cannot Vent,Suicidal

I accidentally wore white to a wedding and cant stop shamespiraling Selfforgiveness with anxiety Yesterday I attended my boyfriends cousins wedding and wore a short creamcolored dress with a black pattern The color literally did not occur to me when I got dressed I picked it because I felt bloated and it was flowy and thats as far as my brain got At the reception my boyfriends mom spilled red wine on my dress As I tried to dab out the stain I caught myself saying see this is why I never wear whiteand then it hit me I spiraled into an anxiety attack and left the reception to go back to my hotel to change I felt like such an asshole such an idiot and I still cant shake that feeling I sat in the secondtolast row at the ceremony at the very end of the row away from the aisle thank God It was a casual wedding People were there in jeans No one said anything to me And it was genuinely an accident A very stupid accident But it was also my first time meeting my boyfriends extended family and Im now convinced they all hate me I cant think about anything else I feel like such a fuckup like Im a bad person Logically I know its not the end of the world I know if THAT was my biggest asshole move in recent memory Im doing OK But I dont FEEL any of that Selfforgiveness seems truly impossible with anxiety sometimes,Anxiety/Stress
Wall of Eye Floaters Help So I have floaters Evident by the fact Im posting here Whether they stay or go away in a few years I dont care 23 so I have all the time to wait One thing that Ive recently noticed though is that when I almost close my eyes completely and look up at the sky during the day I can see an entire faint sheet of what I assume is the liquid my floaters are in and I can see the entire field of my vision is in what essentially looks like a very faint wall of bubbly protiens and crap When my eyes are wide open its harder to see but in the sky I can still ever so slightly notice it My question is has anyone had this along with the more prominent floaters and did the wall eventually go away I dont mind the individual ones but having literally all my vision be through this murky shit is stressing me out,Anxiety/Stress
WHY GET ANGARY Do you get angry when your child is not listening to you Do you feel angry when your boss scolds you Do you feel hurt when your team members are not achieving the target irrespective of your training Anger is common Wellmanaged anger can used be a constructive emotional tool that motivates you to make positive changes It aids to keep a distance from toxic people and situations and creates a positive fire within us If not dealt with it in a positive way or if we allow ourselves to prolong it will lead to destructive results that take a toll on your heContinue Readinghttpsfeellitentwordpresscom202212197quotesthatwilldestroyangar,Anxiety/Stress

Hey If you are reading this I am probably dead Or not No use in putting this off further I am Forrest Or Wes for short if that is what you would prefer I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts since I was about 8 Or I suppose even less than that And there is just something about being passively suicidal that is been helping me realize things throughout my shortlived journey Everyday I find things and reasons on why I should end it right here and there Despite how I do not see the world in rose tinted glasses I consider myself idealistic even I would refuse to let my anxiety get the better of myself I wake up early in the morning try to do everything I am supposed to do Actively try to enjoy everything that I am supposed to Friends family school hobbies And you know what It worked But there comes a time that everything just falls apart because somehow that shitty feeling just crawls its way back to you and finds you again further terrorizing your life To be fair it is always been there On that span of years I did make plans but most of them ended up with me crying on the floor and calling myself a coward for not going through it Everything I thought I lived for was no longer what I lived for I existed for it If I did not do constantly fine there is something wrong with me I know that this is not the case at all But every fiber on my being just says otherwise And I hate it I hate how I cannot control it But do I actually hate it I do not even know anymore I have became too numb because apparently trying to live takes everything out of you and drains you Now I only try to exist Wash my face in the mornings and do well get straight As Because that is all I know that is all I know to do I do not know what else I can do I guess I do but I do not have any means to do it I do not want to admit it but I am scared I am scared to do anything different Though we do not always get what we want Look at me now an empty subhuman husk Everything in my life is slowly plummeting Things I thought I lived for was just me trying to act like I am human That everythings fine because I am scared of not being fine I know that everyone has their bad days and all that but fuck I cannot control what I am scared of And I hate it Each passing day I come with the awareness that there is something perpetually wrong with me and that I probably need help But I cannot get help due to personal situations even if I wanted to Of course I am young I have so many years ahead of me So much time for change Again it does not feel like it And I hate it I hate feeling I have become so overwhelmed by it that everything in me just shuts down until my body brings it up again and now I am a depressive mess I am constantly stuck in this paradox of knowing that everythings going to be fine and hating otherwise Because that implies that I am not alright I am a mess But I do not want to be a mess I cannot accept being a mess For years I tried to desperately to escape it and try to get all the support I am supposed to get Family friends school hobbies Even that failed too Maybe I am not just doing anything right I just want to pretend that I am Because my silly brains been conditioned to think that its just the world that is wrong and not me Deep down I know that there is something wrong with me And the feeling part of myself that I do not like agrees Hell maybe it is neither or both Who knows I can try thinking about it but I would end up with a nondefinitive answer Again my name is Forrest And I am 13 I am a good student I have no social life and my social skills are stunted And what you are reading is one of the suicidal notes I made I have been orchestrating my suicide note since I was 8 I do not want your sympathy because it is probably too late for that Even then if I were alive I would not want it I want you to understand My vague suicide note that I wrote on a depressive episode,Suicidal

What would you do here Throwaway becuase my family knows my account For some time now I observed symptoms that my mother is showing which make me really afraid that she might have cancer She is 50 years old and recently started complaining about one sided back pain she did a lot of physical labor all her live but still concerning having to urinate more often and feeling full sooner Ever since my own Doc informed me about the risks of ovarian cancer I cant get it out of my head I made her see the doctor but she just went for a normal checkup instead of asking for an ultrasound They did take a blood sample but that is hardly enough to rule this out right I really want to let this go because right now it will be impossible to make her go again and I got enough else to worry about On the other hand if I am right and stop pushing her it will be my fault it wasnt found early enough The hell do I do now,Anxiety/Stress

Please can you give me some advice on how to help my long distance partner through a deep depression He is telling me that he wants to give up on everything and I am extremely worried about him He thinks that he is holding me back and that he is not good for me and he admitted that he was considering breaking up with me because of this But I can clearly see that this is not he wants and he is just hurting himself by doing so He also admitted he is trying to push me away because he is hurting me but will not communicate with me about what hes going through or how he feelsI have tried as many things as I can think of listeningbeing here for him suggested doctor visits for trying medscounselling mindfulness suggested exercises and to meet up with friends and family there is more but that is some examples Despite this he continues to tell me that he wants to give up on himself and keeps saying that we should not be together quoting I wish things were easier I wish things did not mess up the way it did But I just want to let you go because you do not deserve any of that and I will keep hurting you if we keep going But I am 100 sure that he does not want to give up on us and that he is just so deep in his depression right now that he cannot see a way out so hes pushing me away to because me less hurt but its actually hurting me way more to know hes thinking about leaving me I am sorry for all of the text but I just wanted to get some advice from outsiders Obviously there is more to it than this but I do not want to write a whole novel hahah So please if there is anything you can think of then let me know because I really do not want to lose this man we are so good for each other and I want to support him through what hes experiencing right now so we can be in each others arms againSome extra context my boyfriend is 24 and I am 21 We have been together for over 3 years now and do not often arguefall out He has been struggling with undiagnosed depression for over a year now Following this he recently found out that a family member has been diagnosed with cancer which he is understandably struggling with We were also supposed to be moving in together within the next month but I can tell he is struggling from the pressure of finding a place In the past two weeks we took a 1 week break of not talking to each other to try and reflect on things We both found this extremely difficult and are now suffering because of it Yesterday he told me he was considering breaking up with me during the break which was a huge shock to also he has never said anything like this to me before I just do not want to lose him and wish he could realise that breaking up is really not the right choice He is not thinking straight right now and I just want to help him but I do not know howThanks so much in advance Need advice on helping my ldr partner through depression,Depression
Lumps appearing overnight So I dont post much on reddit but recently Ive starting to see more and more lumps appearing on my body First was back in November on the lower left section of my abdomen Two weeks ago two appeared near the last rip of my rips cage one on each side I went to the doctor yesterday and she said theyre most likely cyst and to not worry about them Although ts might just be me being paranoid but I swear more grew over night It is common for cyst to appear quickly on the body or is it something else,Anxiety/Stress

Its crazy how others do not understand that I am going to be like this forever Someone once told me Your depression is not you its only a tiny part of you But how come my depression has took over every single part of me that I genuinely do not remember who I am anymore For the past five years I had to watch myself crumble and I could not do a damn thing about it If I could do it all over again I would have done everything differently But now I am going to college I am not even happy about it I used to dream about going to college as a kid all the time that Id be the most happiest and successful person ever I used to think once Id go I would be normal I would feel freeGuess that was a lie because the only reason I am going is to fill that void and have constant stress so I do not have to listen to the bad thoughts in my mind that is it Over and outA I really will be like this for the rest of my life,Depression
I am trying to resist it is so difficult I no longer find happiness in anything everything that gave me joy now is just a memory I try to see the positive in what happens in my life but I no longer find reasons to stay here I think the only one and for very little is my family it hurts me to know that if I do they would suffer for my absence I try new things I look for more friends and all that but now nothing It keeps me distracted enough to think that one day I have to end this what I have no longer feels like life I just experience a very great decline in everything I am increasingly disappointed with so many things and at the same time I feel that I am a disappointment and a burden to others many people leave my life for no reason and sometimes I am left wondering what I do wrong time passes and I get worse I help everyone I can but nobody helps me I give everything for them and they nothing for me I feel great emotion thinking that the end is so close and sometimes I fantasize for a long time thinking about how I can die without it feeling like a suicideI think it is only a matter of time before I find the moment I think about seeking help but I do not think it can help much my effort to be better every day has seldom had an effect because there are more times that I fail I do not even know how to explain what I feel it is euphoria along with doom and a little hope the problem is that I do not know what I am expecting No pain no gain,Suicidal

Bout of Bad Anxiety Should I consider Therapy Over the last 2 weeks my 30M Anxiety had gotten worse to the point of finding it difficult to sleep no appetite tight chest cant focus on work and upset stomach My doctor proscribed me some very low dose xanax for 10 days and also some other anxiety meds that take around 2 weeks to start working Im hesitant to take any of it though I dont want to feel dependent on meds and then when i stop taking them the anxiety comes back My long term girlfriend and I broke up earlier in 2022 but we would sometimes keep in touch and see each occasionally We went to college together but didnt date in college so alot of her friends are my friends also She moved 6 hrs away for a job before we broke up and that was part of why we broke up along with other things It was easy being with her from the friends aspect but deep down inside there were some things that really bothered me about our relationship We always tried to make it work but it just didnt She ended things with me but we are on good terms She recently told me that she is seeing someone and ever since then it has bothered the hell out of me and have had all this anxiety since Its making me think did I make the right decision in pretty much agreeing to break up to the point we spoke on the phone and she said sorry but its over between us I have gotten anxiety bouts before but its always about job deadlines or things that once over the anxiety goes away This is different I know my relationship with her in a romantic way is over and the severity of this anxiety is much worse than anything I have felt before Should i consider going to therapy or will just pass in due time Thought,Anxiety/Stress

THIS is why I hate doctors Ive found there are two different types of health anxiety 1 You seek out medical advice for any and all issues or 2 You avoid doctors and tests like the plague because youre scared of bad results I am 2 7 years ago when I was 22 I had an OBGYN who badly needed clients bring me in 4x in a month unnecessarily to test me for slightly abnormal results on various things She told me I could have everything from kidney failure to cervical cancer and kept running test after test Every visit she thought I was something else I had no symptoms this all started with amy first annual exam with her I freaked out so bad that my parents were concerned about my mental wellbeing I went to my family GP back home who talked me off a cliff and retested me for everything I was fine Fast forward 7 years Im now pregnant I havent been to an OBGYN since that first doctor and am terrified I was recommended a new OBGYN who was supposed to be really great I go I submit routine bloodwork which was super scary for me due to previous experience I get a call from new OBGYN telling me I tested positive for Hepatitis C that it is chronic and incurable and questioned about IV drug use I run back in for follow up tests to tell me how bad I have it Follow up tests show that I do not in fact have Hepatitis C at all Doctor had failed to tell me the false positive rate is up to 50 Oh and per other doctors it is curable if I even did have it There are commercials on TV about said cure for crying out loud Yall I cant take this s anymore I face my worst fear that I have a serious medical condition Im unaware of then Im told theyve found an underlying condition that could kill me and then they TAKE IT ALL BACK I trust one doctor and one doctor only Thats my GP and God help me when he retires,Anxiety/Stress

My Health Anxiety Symptoms Hi Everyone As someone who has been struggling with health anxiety for the last 4 years I have found the acknowledgment of potential anxiety symptoms to be the most reassuring form of support This is not only reassuring to me as it reminds me of all of the different ways anxiety might affect your body it also reminds me and hopefully others that many of these symptoms quickly pass as they are only manifested only as a result of mental illness Heres all of the symptoms that have come and gone as a result of my health anxiety I hope that people may relate and be reassured Ive bolded those symptoms which have remained more constant throughout the last 4 years 1 tingling extremities 2 cold hands and feet 3 muscle spasms mostly in leg thought it was a blood clot it was not 4 tightness of muscles particularly around neck and shoulders 5 dry mouth 6 bruxism 7 chest pain stabbing 8 chest pain dullachey 9 constipationdiarrhea thought this was hypothyroidism it wasnt 10 hair loss thought this was PCOS it wasnt 11 Paralysis like symptoms this came in two ways One overthinking things that should be unconscious me thinking about swallowing resulted in my temporary inability to swallow liquid Two mid panic attack thought I could not move legs 12 pelvic vaginalvulva pain thought this was vulvar cancer literally got a chunk cut out of my vulva to test As soon as results came back negative the pain stopped 13 headaches 14 HEADACHES 15 pressure in head tightness 16 insomnia 17 lethargy 18 difficulty concentrating 19 hearing phantom ringing always hearing my alarm clock even when its not going off 20 jitters That is all I think I hope this helped someone please feel free to ask any questions,Anxiety/Stress
